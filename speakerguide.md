# Speaker Guide

As a speaker, being prepared for an audience that you don’t see directly makes a big difference. It will be much harder for you to get immediate feedback by checking facial expressions. At the same time, the online setting creates new possibilities: you may use a touch screen for a blackboard-style talk, or demonstrate your results more interactively by switching to a different software. Such innovations can be used to great effect if they are prepared well.

Nonetheless, the same general principles apply to a virtual conference as they do to an non-virtual conference. A great seminar will generally be great in both contexts, as long as you are prepared, which includes knowing what to expect and avoiding technical problems. In a virtual conference you won’t need to worry about forgetting your video connection adapter, but you will need to take a few different steps to ensure a smooth process, which we detail below.

## Technical setup
* Find and reserve a room, which you will use to present.
* Your internet connection in that room must be reliable.
* Optimally, the room should be well lit and have no distracting background noise.
* If you can arrange two screens, so that you use one for your presentation, and the other to view the audience, it may help get some visual feedback.
* The sound quality makes a difference: try to find a good external microphone.

## One week before your seminar
Prepare your presentation.
TIP: You will be sharing your screen so no need to rely exclusively on slides. You can seamlessly switch between slides, Jupyter/Mathematica notebook, etc.

Familiarize yourself with the basic features of the video conference platform. We use Zoom, and we recommend downloading its desktop version [here](https://zoom.us/download). 

Make sure that you have reserved a room and tested its technical capabilities as per the “[technical setup](#technical-setup)” section above.

Return the [consent form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccvvnOTIQiFX6idGnWKQOFhQ85QG4c6Xjble9Q0CjkIR2Tjw/viewform) for the recording of your talk.

## One day before your seminar
You will be provided with a link to a testing area on our virtual conferencing platform (currently Zoom). Connect and test your video, audio, microphone, the display of your presentation, etc. Become familiar with the different screen-sharing options (share all screen, share particular program window, etc) to be prepared to choose the correct one.

## The day of your seminar
Join the meeting a few minutes before the start of your talk. Make sure you are undisturbed in a well-lit and quiet room. Try to avoid strong background light sources.

Make sure to turn off any programs that would result in pop-up notifications during your talk. This can include email software, any chat programs (Slack, Google chat, gitter, etc), VOIP software (Skype, etc), or other ones as well like Dropbox.

When it is time for your talk the moderator will introduce you and the topic of your presentation. Then they proceed to unmute you and highlight your screen, so that your feed will be in the main window of all participants. This is the time to share your screen and begin your talk!

## What to expect during your seminar
During your seminar, you will be the only person whose microphone will be continuously streamed to the audience. In general, the participants (including you) cannot mute/unmute themselves; only the moderators have the power to mute/unmute a participant’s microphone.

### What is more difficult to do in a virtual conference
It is difficult, but possible, to interact with the audience in most ways, such as polling the audience with a question. The Zoom platform allows audience members who are familiar with it to respond by displaying affirmative/negative symbols, but this takes more time than in a non-virtual talk and is less easy to gauge proportion of the audience giving one answer or another. So, it is inefficient, but if you feel that it is an important component then this sort of thing can be done. It would be helpful to let the moderator know in advance so that they can briefly remind the audience of the ways they can communicate to respond to such questions from the speaker.

Similarly, it is hard to obtain global non-verbal feedback from the audience, such as facial expressions, so be prepared to present without this. This also goes the other way: The audience cannot see your body language and hand gestures. Make sure you speak slowly and clearly so that the audience has time to process the content of your presentation.

### What is easier to do in a virtual conference
Because you are sitting at your computer, it is easier to use multiple software platforms as part of your presentation. You can easily bring up a Jupyter/Mathematica notebook in order to present your science in a more dynamic way or show how to use a software tool that you developed. Make sure to emphasize visual aspects of your code/software rather than dense code snippets.

Using software like OneNote, GoodNotes (or similar) on a computer setup with a touchscreen and digital pen, you can easily do “chalk talk” style work. This can be either as an intended part of your presentation or as a way to answer questions that would be more easily done that way. So, if you have the capability to do this even if it is not part of your presentation, we recommend for you to have the software and hardware ready to go so that it can be easily put to use when needed.

### Audience questions
Audience members will notify the moderator of questions via a virtual “hand raising” mechanism that the software has built-in. When the moderator notices the raised hand, they will, at their discretion, unmute themselves to stop the presentation if necessary, and then unmute the audience member to let them pose their question and interact with the speaker.

In general there will be two approaches to Q&A depending on the particular conference and the length of your seminar:
If your talk is short (~15 minutes or less) you can expect not to be interrupted at all during your talk, and questions will only be allowed after the seminar is finished.

If your talk is longer (more than ~15 minutes), questions will be allowed during the seminar.

Since you cannot see people "raising hands" and moderator needs to interrupt you to allow for questions, it is generally a good idea to pause for 5-10 seconds from time to time to introduce an opportunity for the possible questions.

Unlike during a regular conference, you will have no option to chat informally after your talk. To compensate for that, we invite you to tell the audience how they can reach you afterwards.

## Recording of your talk
Given you provided your consent prior to your seminar, your talk will be recorded via the Zoom platform. You should also be aware that the participants may take screenshots/their own recordings during your talk.
