Observing Ayons 2020 is a mini-confernece that convenes experts to present and discuss the latest advances on observing anyons in nature. The focus of the conference is on two experimental efforts in 2020 reporting the first observation of fractional statistics in fractional quantum Hall devices. The conference begins with a pedagogical introduction to fractional statistics and quantum Hall systems, followed by presentations by representatives from each experimental group, and concludes with a panel discussion on theoretical and experimental details and future implications of these findings. Program (All times EDT) 9:30 Welcome 9:35 Steven H. Simon , University of Oxford (UK) Leading up to the the Recent Measurement of Fractional Statistics The idea of anyons, particles in two dimensions which are neither bosons nor fermions, was introduced in 1977. By the mid 1980s the community believed that the excitations of fractional quantum Hall systems should be anyons. Forty years later, for the first time, two experiments appear to finally give strong demonstrations of this fact. I will review some of the key developments over the years that have led up to these exciting experiments. 10:10 Gwendal F\u00e8ve , \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (France) Fractional statistics in anyon collisions Hugo Bartolomei, Manohar Kumar, R\u00e9mi Bisognin, Arthur Marguerite, Jean-Marc Berroir, Erwann Bocquillon, Bernard Pla\u00e7ais, Antonella Cavanna, Quan Dong, Ulf Gennser, Yong Jin, Gwendal F\u00e8ve Science 368 , 173 (2020) ; Preprint arXiv:2006.13157 Two-dimensional systems can host exotic particles called anyons whose quantum statistics are neither bosonic nor fermionic. For example, the elementary excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor \\(\\nu=1/m\\) (where \\(m\\) is an odd integer) have been predicted to obey Abelian fractional statistics, with a phase \\(\\phi\\) associated with the exchange of two particles equal to \\(\\pi/m\\) . However, despite numerous experimental attempts, clear signatures of fractional statistics have remained elusive. We experimentally demonstrate Abelian fractional statistics at filling factor \u03bd = \u2153 by measuring the current correlations resulting from the collision between anyons at a beamsplitter. By analyzing their dependence on the anyon current impinging on the splitter and comparing with recent theoretical models, we extract \\(\\phi=\\pi/3\\) , in agreement with predictions. 10:50 James Nakamura , Purdue University (USA) Direct observation of anyonic braiding statistics J. Nakamura, S. Liang, G. C. Gardner & M. J. Manfra, Nature Physics 16 , 931 (2020) ; Preprint arXiv:2006.14115 Anyons are quasiparticles that, unlike fermions and bosons, show fractional statistics when two of them are exchanged. Here, we report the experimental observation of anyonic braiding statistics for the \\(\\nu=1/3\\) fractional quantum Hall state by using an electronic Fabry\u2013Perot interferometer. Strong Aharonov\u2013Bohm interference of the edge mode is punctuated by discrete phase slips that indicate an anyonic phase \\(\\theta_\\text{anyon}=2\\pi/3\\) . Our results are consistent with a recent theory that describes an interferometer operated in a regime in which device charging energy is small compared to the energy of formation of charged quasiparticles, which indicates that we have observed anyonic braiding. 11:30 Break 11:35 Panel Discussion Moderator: Steven H.

Program 9:00 Welcome 9:10 Taeyoung Choi , Ewha Womans University and IBS Center for Quantum Nanoscience, Seoul (South Korea) Electron spin resonance on individual atoms and molecules on surfaces Xue Zhang, Yu Wang, Philip Willke, Aparajita Singa, Minhee Choi, Taeyoug Choi Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of spin properties arising from individual atoms and nanostructures on surfaces have demonstrated nanoscale memory bits and logic gates toward miniaturizing electronic and information devices. In recent years, understanding and controlling individual spins with maintaining quantum coherence become one of highly interesting research topics to utilize the coherent spins for quantum sensing and information processing. Recently, we successfully combined a conventional electron spin resonance (ESR) technique with a spin-polarized STM and coherently drive spins of individual Fe and Ti atoms on ultrathin insulating MgO. Using this newly developed ESR-STM, we studied magnetic interaction of individual atoms that are coupled through magnetic dipolar and exchange interactions. Unique and advantageous aspects of ESR-STM compared to other quantum magnetic sensors (such as NV centers) are the atom manipulation and imaging capabilities, which allow us to build atomically precise nanostructures and examine their interactions. In addition, we found that both a spin-polarized tip and an external magnetic field play important role to drive the single-atom ESR. Utilizing stronger interaction between a spin-polarized tip and an atom on surface, we successfully drive the single-atom ESR without any external magnetic field which may be useful to study spin systems under low magnetic fields. Lastly, we use the ESR-STM technique to investigate single atom-molecule complexes as well as Dy (4f elements) atoms to investigate spin distribution across the complexes and to lengthen the coherence time of the spins. Coherent quantum control of individual atoms on surfaces combined with atom manipulation may promise the STM as a new and unique platform for a quantum sensor, investigating spin-labeled molecular structures and a quantum information processor, modeling quantum magnetism. 9:55 Katharina Franke , FU Berlin (Germany) Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of organic molecules on single-layer MoS 2 on Au(111) Nils Krane, Ga\u00ebl Reecht, Christian Lotze, Katharina Franke Adsorption of organic molecules on metal surfaces typically leads to strong hybridization of the frontier molecular orbitals with the substrate electronic bands. This results in broad energy levels reflecting the ultrashort lifetime of excited molecular states in tunneling experiments. A monolayer of MoS 2 is direct-bandgap semiconductor. Here, we show that single-layer MoS 2 on Au(111) acts as an efficient decoupling layer for organic molecules. The decoupling efficiency is superior to frequently employed ionic layers such as NaCl, or to graphene. Molecular resonances within the semiconducting band gap of MoS 2 exhibit widths of only a few meV. This exquisite energy resolution allows to study vibrational excitations within the individual molecules. Details in the set of vibronic resonances on thienothiophene-based molecules allow for their rotamer identification. The spatial intensity distribution along the molecule further reveals that the simple Franck-Condon picture is insufficient for a complete understanding of the excitation mechanism. 10:40 Jascha Repp , University of Regensburg (Germany) Tunneling microscopy on insulators provides access to out-of-equilibrium charge states Laerte L. Patera, Fabian Queck, Philipp Scheuerer, Jascha Repp Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful tool for the investigation of individual molecules, being able to probe their orbitals with sub-molecular resolution. However, the requirement of a conductive substrate strongly limits the accessible electronic transitions. Conversely, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be extended to insulating substrates, providing structural and electrostatic information. However, electronic states are generally not accessible by AFM. Here we exploit the single-electron sensitivity of AFM [1] in detecting electrostatic forces to establish a novel mode in scanning probe, in which an alternating current instead of a direct current probes the sample. Only a single electron per AFM-cantilever oscillation cycle tunnels between tip and investigated structure back and forth, enabling operation in absence of any conductance of the underlying substrate but still capable of imaging electronic states with Angstrom resolution. Our results unveil the effects of electron-transfer and polaron formation on the single-orbital scale [2]. References: [1] J. Klein, C. C. Williams, Appl. Phys. Lett. 79, 1828 (2001); [2] L. L.

Due to progress in material physics and emergence of new hybrid platforms, this search has resulted in a series of experiments observing a combined effect of chiral edge states and superconductivity. At the same time, measurements of Andreev conductance in the quantum Hall regime demonstrate wildly different behaviors, sometimes in disagreement with existing theoretical predictions. In this workshop we aimed to bring together experts working in the field, review observations and their interpretation, and identify the possible ways forward. Workshop summary Combining Andreev reflection with chiral movement of electrons is an open topic of experimental search and theoretical ideation for more than two decades. While the low magnetic field regime has been observed and offers a clear interpretation, the limit of full Landau quantization has only recently become available to experiments. There are two prominent predicted manifestations of Andreev reflection in the quantum Hall regime. 1) The supercurrent in the chiral regime acquires the Aharanov-Bohm periodicity for magnetic flux penetrating the normal region. 2) A single superconducting electrode enables injection of holes into the downstream current and, in lattice-matched graphene, generates a quantized negative nonlocal resistance. While the supercurrent signature remains unseen, nonlocal resistance measurements finding negative values (with mysteries) feature prominently in recent experimental works. For the overview see Carlo Beenakker's talk below . The three experiments of the workshop used different material platforms and geometries summarized in the table below. The experiment presented by Gleb Finkelstein observed irregular conductance oscillations that rapidly decay with temperature and interface length. This result and the authors' interpretation agree with recent numerical simulations and the analytical theory presented in the satellite talks. This data also exhibits jumps with magnetic field, consistent with the analysis of the effect of vortex entrance. The other two experiments demonstrate a systematically negative downstream resistance with no apparent mesoscopic fluctuations. The results reported by Onder Gul extend to the fractional quantum Hall regime, that was analysed by the authors as well as in one of the satellite talks using the renormalization group approach. The reasons for the difference in the observations are as yet unknown. In addition to these works, the experiment reported by Ivan Kulesh, observed fluctuations in the downstream resitance interpreted as tunneling through the quantum Hall bulk\u2014a phenomenon that may complicate the analysis of Andreev reflection in small samples (relevant to the experiments presented by Onder and Gleb). Speaker , Reference Onder Gul, arXiv:2009.07836 , arXiv:1609.08104 Gleb Finkelstein, arXiv:1907.01722 Javad Shabani, arXiv:2108.08899 Top-down Cross-section Materials Graphene, NbTiN Graphene, MoRe InAs 2DEG, NbTiN Main observations ( \\(R\\) is nonlocal voltage divided by drain current) \\(R \\approx \\textrm{const}< 0\\) for integer and fractional QHE; \\(R \\to 0\\) at \\(W \\gtrsim 0.2\\mu\\textrm{m}\\) Oscillatory \\(R\\) , \\(\\langle G \\rangle = 0\\) ; \\(\\textrm{var}(R) \\to 0\\) with \\(T\\gtrsim 0.2K\\) ; sudden jumps in \\(R(B)\\) \\(R \\approx \\textrm{const} < 0\\) in integer QHE plateaus; \\(R <0\\) persists to \\(I \\gtrsim 5\\mu\\textrm{A}\\) Between the seminars and the discussion session, a number of open questions, needed experiments, and needed theory, were identified. Open questions What is the nature of the persistent negative nonlocal resistances in the measurements presented by Onder and Javad? Is it possible to experimentally observe the influence of valley physics in the graphene versions of these systems? Are the differences in contact types (edge contact for graphene, planar proximitization for InAs) important? Relatedly, what about the difference between a soft and hard edge potential in the NS contact region? Can the negative influence of the superconducting vortices be eliminated in the experiment? Can the systematic difference between Andreev and normal reflections be explained by the breaking of particle-hole symmetry by the finite bias? Ideas for further experiments Noise measurement to reveal the charge of the Andreev reflected holes. Tunneling into the possible zero mode at the end of the finger in the geometry presented by Onder. Quantum point contact at QH-superconductor interface. Chicken-wire patterns for superconducting films to minimize the presence of vortex normal cores. Chern insulator normal regions for low-external-field versions of these experiments. Type-II superconductors with high Hc1 so that QH develops before vortices. Workshop videos The search for chiral Andreev edge states By Carlo Beenakker , Leiden University Video minutes [time=0:01:31] Skipping-orbits for both electrons and holes are in the same direction (opposite sign of both charge and mass). Expt. 10.1103/PhysRevB.76.115313 [time=0:04:52] Chiral modes don't necessarily transport a unit of charge. The transferred charge can even be zero. [time=0:05:31] The early works in the field are in \"skipping orbit\" limit. It is important to reach the single Landau level regime. [time=0:07:19] In graphene, Andreev reflection switches the valleys. Furthermore, the lowest Landau level in graphene is valley polarized. Therefore, there is no electron-hole conversion when the superconductor covers a single edge. [time=0:07:19] Valley polarization sets a selection rule for Andreev processes in graphene. [time=0:07:19] A two-terminal setup is considered in the theoretical work, while a three-terminal setup in the experiment. For a clean interface, quantized conductance is expected [ arXiv:cond-mat/0612698 ]. In the experiment, conductance is not quantized and has irregular fluctuations [ arXiv:1907.01722 ]. [time=0:10:08] Interface disorder plays a major role [ arXiv:2103.06722 ]. Not as universal as one would desire. [time=0:12:10] Chiral Andreev edge modes can carry supercurrent in a two-terminal Josephson junction setup. [time=0:13:53] For a squid ring, \\(4\\pi\\) -periodicity in flux difference ( \\(\\delta \\phi\\) ) in the critical current is expected (so-called \\(4\\pi\\) periodic Fraunhofer oscillations). But, in the experiment by Amet et al. Science 352, 966 (2016) , period-doubling is not observed. Questions period [time=0:16:53] Q (Yoichi Ando): In these experiments, how do we consider spins? A: For odd filling factor, spin-orbit coupling is critical for Andreev reflection processes (for odd filling factor). The reason is that spin-polarized edge states are not supposed to feature Andreev reflection. [time=0:18:16] Q (Leonid Glazman): Remarks that there were earlier experimental works than the one presented by Carlo. [time=0:19:13] Q: Referring to slide 3 of Carlo's talk: in the bottom left picture, it really depends on the deatils of the lattice because the boundary. Could one deform the top in the bottom picture? Is there any intermediate point? See Figure 1 from arXiv:cond-mat/0612698 A: In general, any graphene edge behaves as zigzag in long lengthscales ( arXiv:0710.2723 ), which means that valley is a good quantum number. Thus, isospins in different edges can only be paralell or anti-parallel. What really matters is that if you cover a single edge or two edges. Crossed Andreev reflection in fractional quantum Hall graphene devices By \u00d6nder G\u00fcl , Harvard University Based on arXiv:2009.07836 and arXiv:1609.08104 Video minutes [time=0:02:50] The valley number is not a good quantum number for the disordered edges. [time=0:05:31] CAR process at odd filling factors is only possible via spin-orbit coupling. [time=0:06:24] Superconducting pairing was observed in the spin-polarized channel. Thus, edge states must couple with their counter-propagating partners at the other side of the superconductor (SC) finger. [time=0:05:58] CAR probabilities for integer filling factors do not change with external magnetic field. [time=0:08:12] Fermi level mismatch is unavoidable. [time=0:08:12] Local gate close to the SC finger was used to change the filling factor in the vincinity of the SC. [time=0:11:43] Particle-like fractional, e.g. \\(\\nu=1/3\\) , quantum Hall edge states have enhanced Andreev signal as magnetic field increase. Integer fillings don't change. Fractional and integer states also show different temperature behaviour. [time=0:15:53] Control experiment 1: gold finger. No negative signal. Control experiment 2: wider finger. No negative signal as well. Control experiment 3: longer finger. Negative resistance is still observed. [time=0:17:52] Disorder limits CAR probability, due to the direct tunneling. Vortices should also limit CAR probability. [time=0:19:12] Future experiments: Noise measurement to reveal the charge of the Andreev reflected holes. Tunneling into the zero mode at the end of the finger. [time=0:19:55] Non-saturating temperature dependence for fractional fillings. Questions period There were no questions due to time limitations. Supercurrent and Andreev edge states in the quantum Hall regime By Gleb Finkelstein , Duke University Based on arXiv:1901.05928 and arXiv:1907.01722 Video minutes [time=0:01:41] The current understanding of the supercurrent is separate Andreev bound states (ABSs) along each edge, as opposed to previous hypothesis based on chiral Andreev edge states. [time=0:01:41] Electrostatics close to the edges of the sample are controlled by side gates, which changes the filling factor at the edges. [time=0:07:00] No periodic signal as long as charge density monotonically decreases close to the edge. [time=0:07:54] Second gate: periodic pattern of critical current, \\(I_c\\) , vs. magnetic field, \\(B\\) , indicating SQUID geometry between two opposite edges. [time=0:08:42] Andreev edge states are not involved in generation of the supercurrent. [time=0:10:04] Downstream longitudinal resistance ( \\(R_{xx}\\) ) and conventional Hall resistance are measured. \\(R_{xx}\\) decays to zero with increasing temperature, recovering conventional QH behaviors. [time=0:10:15] Negative downstream resistance ( \\(R_{xx}<0\\) ) observed for \\(\\nu=1\\) . [time=0:12:39] Changing the ground to a metallic contact recovers the expected zero downstream resistance in the absence of a superconductor. [time=0:13:23] The downstream resistance is positive for electrons and negative for holes. The measured \\(R_{xx}\\) signal depends on the wavelength difference of the two chiral Andreev edge states. \\(V_\\mathrm{gate}\\) changes the wavevector, leading to an oscillatory behavior. [time=0:16:30] Changing bias voltage also leads to oscillations because the momentum difference of chiral Andreev edge states changes with energy. [time=0:18:35] Abrupt switching with magnetic fields is caused by vortices . Zooming in, one can see regions between the abrupt transitions that are smooth. (See also Vladislav Kurilovich talk .) [time=0:20:44] On average, the system is neutral as can be seen from the longitudinal resistance statistics. See Figure 2c from arXiv:1907.01722 ) [time=0:21:43] If there are vortices (being sinks for quasiparticles) in the superconductor, then the signal is suppressed. [time=0:21:43] The signal decays as the superconducting contact length is increased, due to dephasing. Questions period There were no questions due to time limitations. Integer quantum Hall effect with a superconducting contact By Javad Shabani , New York University Based on arXiv:2108.08899 and ongoing work Video minutes [time=0:01:54] SC and Quantum Hall (QH) physics give rise to Majoranas (integer QH) or parafermions (fractional QH). [time=0:03:39] Disorder in InAs materials is not as large compared to GaAs materials. [time=0:04:27] There is a trade-off between mobility and contact quality. [time=0:05:17] Measured interface transparency is close to 1. [time=0:05:47] For QH, you also want a SC with a high critical field . One can use NbTiN. [time=0:05:47] Deposition of SC material is done in controlled environment. [time=0:07:03] The normal-superconductor (NS) interface is \\(150\\mu m\\) long, much longer than the other works. [time=0:08:21] Negative downstream resistance ( \\(R_{xx}\\) ) due to Andreev reflection. [time=0:09:52] The Hall resistance is recovered if one computes the difference between upstream and downstream resistances. Deviations appear near the transitions between plateaus. [time=0:12:05] Negative downstream signal is suppressed with bias current ( \\(I_{\\mathrm{bias}} \\sim \\mu A\\) ). [time=0:15:57] When the NS interface is not cleaned, QH phase is still visible but the negative downstream resistance is barely seen. On the other hand, for the cleaned samples, the negative downstream resistance regime is clearly visible. [time=0:17:09] Grounding at different contacts leads to nearly the same result. [time=0:18:59] Next step: quantum point contact at SC interface. The same has been done in Charlie Marcus's group. Questions period There were no questions due to time limitations. Panel discussion with speakers and the participants Video minutes [time=0:01:51] Q (from Valla Fatemi to \u00d6nder Gul): What is the expected or measured Fermi level mismatch between NbN and Au with respect to graphene? A: Fermi level mismatch is known to exist. Accumulation in a region of \\(\\sim 50 nm\\) . Due to the fabrication, estimations might not be representative. We expect to have accumulation type of mismatch. [time=0:04:24] Q (from Anton Akhmerov to \u00d6nder Gul): In the measurement, \\(R_{xx}\\) is about to turn negative at 2K, is that correct? Do you have lower temperature dependence data? Would you expect \\(R_{xx}\\) to turn negative, too? A: \\(R_{xx}\\) seems to be crossing zero. But there are no measurements at lower temperatures for this sample. Numbers were extracted from a bias-dependent measurement. In a different device, at 15 mK, the \\(R_{xx}\\) does not seem to cross zero. [time=0:07:12] Q (from Mohit Gupta to Javad Shabani): In working with InAs with epitaxial coupling to Al, has there been any issues obtaining the interference pattern (Fraunhofer Oscillations) in 2-terminal Josephson junctions? In working with this material we are able to reproduce all the published characteristics except for the interference pattern. Understandably there can be many reasons for this but any insights will be helpful. A: Josephson junction with NbTiN was never done but is a possibility. [time=0:08:16] Q (from Anton Akhmerov to Javad Shabani): Why do you see a more complex pattern of plateaus in the \\(B\\) vs \\(V_g\\) diagram than the usual Landau fan? A: Crossings in LL fan: multi-subbands. [time=0:08:50] Q (from Yuval Ronen to Javad Shabani): InAs is known to have accumalation of charge near the end of the 2DEG. did you try making similar JJ in the QHE to the one Gleb showed? Maybe there is SC currents also between the different SC contacts in the experiment you showed? A: There is, indeed, surface charge accumulation in InAs. However, there is an extra InGaAs layer, so charge distribution is known pretty well. There was no charge accumulation control at the edges of the sample. Q (from \u00d6nder Gul to Javad Shabani): Remarks that there will be charge accumulation at the NS interface. A: The structure is somewhat different. There is an InAs pocket which is proximitized by the superconductor. Therefore, 2DEG devices are not that similar to graphene. CQED measurement suggests that InAs density under the superconductor is increased by a factor by 5-10. [time=0:07:12] Q: For Javad Shabani -- the SC contact of the NbTiN is on top of the Al or not? Are you etching with ion milling in-situ? and sputter NbTiN? how do you know when to stop, effect of disorder? From Yuval Ronen A: SC contact (proximity effect?) from top is better than edge or side contact. [time=0:11:50] Q: For anyone -- Is there a conceptual difference between a side contact and a top contact, assuming that both work, which one would be better? A: From Onder Gul -- It depends on material combinations and 2DEG properties. Best contact is the one that couples without doping. The interface may become disorder free without Fermi level mismatch. Perhaps a better option is to use vdW superconductor. In this way, the interface may be disorder free. A: From Javad Shabani -- You want strong induced SC and high transparent contact. In InAs at zero field make good transparency contancs. Requires further experiments to say the same at high field. In graphene I don't know what is the transparency at zero field. Data interpretation [time=0:14:30] Q (to Javad Shabani): \u2013 The Harvard experiment observes negative downstream current that grows with smaller filling fraction. Does this also apply to your experiment? A: If you have a well define QH with large gap, large B, this physics manifests better. Best case for $ u=2$, at 11 T, but then keep in mind that the gap is larger. B-field: tradeoff between large QH gap and large SC gap. Ideally, best gap at lowest density. [time=0:16:30] Q: (from Srijit Goswami to Javad Shabani): For the bias dependence you showed, roughly what values of voltage would the currents correspond to? And how do these voltages compare to the superconducting gap? (Regarding the plot showing resistance as a function of current bias and magnetic field) A: \\(\\sim 100\\mu V\\) [time=0:18:22] Q (from Valla Fatemi to Javad Shabani): In the subtrated \\(R_U-R_D\\) data, there seems to be a systematic deviation between the blue and red curves as a function of gate voltage in the transition between plateaus. Blue is higher to the left and lower to the right of the transition. Is this understood? From Valla Fatemi. A: The simple picture, at QH they match. Before QH state, you have depth and rise, and it alternates. At the edges you have something more complicated, but the observation is correct. Needs further thinking. [time=0:19:39] Q (from Anton Akhmerov to everyone): Can nonchiral edge states play a role in systematically enabling negative current by enabling local Andreev reflection? How can an experiment rule them out? A (Gleb Finkelstein): When you're looking for supercurrent, the two contacts are close. In the Hall bar setup, Andreev states propagate about half micron long. When the distance between contact is longer, the non-chiral just localize in between somewhere. What happens near the contact, is much more difficult to address (perhaps one could control with local gates). Based on what we see, we don't believe there are not many counterpropagating edge states. We cannot exclude additional states near the contact, but probably the number is small. It is very hard to see their presence. A (Lingfei Zhao): Counter propagating edge states probably don't matter in the normal edges because the \\(R_{xy}\\) is still quantized. But at the interface it is hard to check. A: (\u00d6nder Gul): Cannot conclude as well. Residual edge from Fermi level mismatch must lead to counter-propagating edge states. A (Javad Shabani): InAs g-factor is really large. Don't know how the edge state resconstruction varies between graphene and InAs. All in all: hard to conclude anything in the current experiments. [time=0:28:06] Q (from Anton Akhmerov to everyone): What about bulk conduction? Current through nonequilibrium field distribtuion. A (Javad Shabani): If the gap is contribtuing to conductance, it should show up in the measurement. A (Bertrand Halperin): If you are deep inside the QH state, then transport current is pretty much from the edge. If you map it, indeed there's current in the bulk, but doesn't contribute to transport. We should not care where the current is flowing in microscopic sense. Theoretical aspects [time=0:31:46] Q (from Anton Akhmerov to Vladislav Kurilovich and Leonid Glazman): You computed Andreev conductance near a superconductor and you observed rapidly fluctuating result. Can you imagine a situation in which this would not be the case and a systematic negative conductance would be expected? A (Vladislav Kurilovich): Answer is no. Javad's data is peculiar. It should exhibit mesoscopic oscillations but there is unexpected persistent negative downstream resistance. A (Leonid Glazman): Proximitization is differnt. In Javad's experiment the InAs is proximitized. In graphene, it's direct contact with the superconductor. R (Anton Akhmerov): There is also a graphene experiment that also observes a systematic negative downstream current. R (Javad Shabani): There is an experiment with larger sample size in which they don't observe negative resistence anymore. Q (Javad Shabani): Why would vortices matter? A (From Glazman): A vortex effectively work as normal island. [time=0:36:12] Q (Philip Kim): A question about the doping ranges. InAs the SC is on top. I wonder if the schematic drawn by Javad holds. A (Javad Shabani): Soft potential vs. hard potential is relevant to this. [time=0:38:03] Q (from Valla Fatemi to Javad Shabani): Any sort of direct experiments about the presence/density/location of vortices in high fields? Have you tried field cooling the sample? From Valla. A: No direct evidence. The vortices don't want to be at the interface. Chicken wire patterns in the superconductor: no qualitative difference when these patterns are added (but context was different). [time=0:39:18] Q (from Antonio Manesco to everyone): In graphene, one could expect constant conductance due to valley selection rule. But, for 2DEGs, one would expect chiral Andreev interference all the way (even without disorder). How to understand constant negative conductance then? From Antonio. R (Anton Akhmerov): As Leonid pointed out, even if the system was clean one would expect an oscillatory signal, not just constant and negative. A (Enrico Rossi): You have vortices as sink for the electrons. You keep losing holes to the vortices. This can explain negative resistance. The superconductor is grounded. The holes don't have the same tendency going to the ground. Q (Anton Akhmerov): Shouldn't the absorption rate be the same for electrons and holes? A (Enrico Rossi): The superconductor is grounded, so it could attract more electrons than holes. A (Leonid Glazman): If DOS is energy-independent, and there is PHS, there shouldn't be no difference expected between electrons and holes. So this is not enough to explain the constantly negative signal. But maybe the non-linearity of the semiconductor dispersion is important. A (Anton Akhmerov): Indeed, the non-linearity could be the reason for such asymmetry. But then the signal should vanish at zero bias. R (Gleb Finkelstein): Positive and negative signals amplitudes are similar (particle-hole symmetric). Survival probablity decays with the length of the interface. [time=0:43:19] Q (from Ivan Kulesh): All experiments have similar scheme of measurements. Both groups (P.K & G.F.) see that increased bias makes signal disappear above the gap. Javad sees negative resistance at 10 mA (100 times of the SC gap). What to expect if Andreev physics did not disappear? A (Javad Shabani): You cannot just insert bias current into the edge states. In our systems, filling factors are high. The excitation energy is \\(\\sim 100 \\mu V\\) . [time=0:49:50] Q (Lingfei Zhao): About the nonlinear dependence of InAs dispersion: could there be a local electric field effect close to the superconductor? A (Anton Akhmerov): Skeptical about the effect to be strong to give negative CAR. Ideas for further experiments Two similar questions: Is it possible to obtain pristine oscillations in CAES using a type-II superconductor having a high Hc1, before magnetic fields when vortices start developing? (from Rajarshi Bhattacharyya) For experimentalists \u2013 Do you imagine a way to minimize effects of vortices? (from Antonio Manesco) A (Javad Shabani): One idea is the chicken wire patterns to trap vortices. But ideally one wants to work at really small fields. So another idea is to put very thin Al on top of InAs (critical field in Al can reach 4T). Applying out-of-plane field, the superconductor survives. Then one can choose superconductors such as Nb or Ta instead of granular superconductors. In other words: use vertical superconducting contacts. [time=0:54:09] R (Valla Fatemi) - A possible control experiment that simulates low DOS (like vortices) but without AR: use a contact of the material in question tuned by a gate to near a transition to an insulator, where resistance is high and puddles probably dominate to keep things inhomogeneous. [time=1:06:29] Idea from Valla: Chern insulators lessen the need for external magnetic fields, so this is potentially beneficial for avoiding vortices!

The topics I intend to cover are the following: Floquet theorem Decomposition to stroboscopic- and micro-motions Sambe picture (space-time picture) Effective Floquet Hamiltonian and High-frequency expansion Examples: Dynamic localization, inverted pendulum Graphene in circularly polarized laser (Topology, Floquet spectrum, application of the Sambe picture) Floquet Kubo formula and TKNN formula Topology and non-equilibrium dynamics of Floquet systems by Mark Rudner Floquet engineering is a powerful technique for eliciting interesting behaviors from quantum many-body systems through time-periodic driving. While the goal in many cases is to use the external drive to get the system to mimic topological or other phenomena known or predicted for equilibrium systems, periodic driving brings a variety of exciting opportunities and challenges for exploring novel regimes of quantum many-body dynamics. In these lectures I will cover the unique aspects of topology in periodically driven systems, which offer new paradigms beyond those of equilibrium topological phases and phenomena. Along the way we will discuss experimental manifestations and open questions, along with theoretical tools and pictures that can provide valuable insight into the intriguing dynamics of interacting, driven systems. Introduction to time-resolved simulations in quantum nanoelectronics by Xavier Waintal and Thomas Kloss In these lectures, I will discuss the theory of quantum transport at frequencies beyond the GHz range where one starts to probe the internal dynamics of the device. In the first part, I will introduce several concepts and show specific examples of effects that have no anaalogue at small frequencies. Then, I will discuss in some details the formalism, explaining in particular how to switch back and forth between the Green\u2019s function approach and the scattering wave function approach. Last, together with Thomas Kloss, we will show you concretely how to perform your own simulations with the python package Tkwant ( http://tkwant.kwant-project.org ). Quasi-periodically driven systems by Anushya Chandran TBC Realizing synthetic gauge fields with ultracold atoms using Floquet engineering by Monika Aidelsburger Topological phases of matter exhibit remarkable electronic properties. A prominent example is the robust quantization of the Hall conductivity in quantum Hall insulators. A widespread technique for generating topological band structures in synthetic quantum systems, such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices, is Floquet engineering. In my lectures, I will discuss how the technique of periodic driving can be used to break time-reversal symmetry and to engineer artificial magnetic fields in order to realize topological lattice models, such as the Hofstadter and the Haldane model. I will further introduce experimental methods that have been developed to study and characterize the topological properties of the engineered band structures. One prominent example is the observation of a Hall deflection with charge-neutral bosonic atoms. The second part of my lecture will be devoted to the rich topological properties of periodically-driven systems that transcend those of their static counterparts. The associated quasienergy spectrum can exhibit a non-trivial winding number, which leads to the appearance of anomalous chiral edge modes even in situations where the bulk bands have zero Chern numbers and therefore appear to be topologically trivial. I will show how wavepacket dynamics can be used to study the bulk and edge topological properties of the system. The novel properties of topological Floquet phases open the door to exciting new many-body topological phases out-ofequilibrium. At the end I will provide a brief outlook on recent efforts in using Floquet engineering to study dynamical gauge fields and lattice gauge theories. Floquet Topological Photonics by Mikael Rechtsman The breaking of time-reversal symmetry is a particular challenge for photons, since as uncharged particles they do not naturally respond to external magnetic fields. As a result, driving photonic systems periodically has been used as a natural means to realize photonic Chern insulators and their associated scatter-free chiral edge states. Here, I will provide an overview of Floquet topological photonic systems, including the first realization of topological states of light. I will then move on to talk about the interplay of topology, driving, and interactions/nonlinearity, and how together these can be more than the sum of their parts. Finally, I will talk about unique device applications of topological photonic devices that go beyond standard analogies between condensed matter and photonic crystals.

In this talk, I will argue that the correlated insulator recently observed in WSe2/WS2 at half filling is a charge-transfer insulator similar to cuprates, in which hole doping induces a charge from anion-like to cation-like orbitals at different locations in the Moir\u00e9 unit cell [1]. Interestingly, at small doping, tightly-bound charge-2e \"trimers\" consisting of two holes bound to a charge-transfer exciton can form to lower the total electrostatic repulsion [2]. When the bandwidth of doped holes is small, trimers crystallize into insulating pair density waves at a sequence of commensurate doping levels. When the bandwidth becomes comparable to the pair binding energy, itinerant holes and charge-2e trimers interact resonantly, leading to unconventional superconductivity similar to superfluidity in an ultracold Fermi gas near Feshbach resonance. Charles Marcus, Center for Quantum Devices and Microsoft Quantum Lab, Copenhagen Zero-field Topological Superconductivity in Ferromagnetic Hybrid Nanowires abstract We report transport measurements and tunneling spectroscopy in hybrid nanowires with epitaxial layers of superconducting Al and the ferromagnetic insulator EuS, grown on semiconducting InAs nanowires. In devices where the Al and EuS covered facets overlap, we infer a remanent effective Zeeman field of order 1 T, and observe stable zero-bias conductance peaks in tunneling spectroscopy into the end of the nanowire, consistent with topological superconductivity at zero applied field. Hysteretic features in critical current and tunneling spectra as a function of applied magnetic field support this picture. Nanowires with non-overlapping Al and EuS covered facets do not show comparable features. Topological superconductivity in zero applied field allows new device geometries and types of control. Vidya Madhavan, Department of Physics and Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Microscopic evidence for a chiral superconducting order parameter in the heavy fermion superconductor \\(\\text{UTe}_2\\) abstract Spin-triplet superconductivity is a condensate of electron pairs with spin-1 and an odd-parity wavefunction. A particularly interesting manifestation of triplet pairing is a chiral p-wave state which is topologically non-trivial and a natural platform for realizing Majorana edge modes. Triplet pairing is however rare in solid state systems. The best-known example of chiral spin-triplet paring is the superfluid 3He-A phase and over the last few decades, there has been an intensive search for potential spin-triplet superconductors in solid-state systems. Since pairing is most naturally mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations, uranium based heavy fermion systems containing f-electron elements that can harbor both strong correlations and magnetism are considered ideal candidate spin-triplet superconductors. In this work I will present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data on the newly discovered heavy fermion superconductor, $\\textrm{UTe}_2$ with a $T_{\\textrm{SC}}$ of 1.6K. I will show signatures of coexisting Kondo effect and superconductivity which show competing spatial modulations within one unit-cell. STM spectroscopy at step edges show signatures of chiral in-gap states, predicted to exist at the boundaries of a topological superconductor. Combined with existing data indicating triplet pairing, the presence of chiral edge states suggests that UTe2 is a strong candidate material for chiral-triplet topological superconductivity. Nicola Spaldin, ETH Z\u00fcrich From Materials to Cosmology: Studying the early universe under the microscope abstract Uncovering the behavior of the early universe just after the Big Bang is an intriguing fundamental activity that is extraordinarily difficult because of insurmountable issues associated with replaying the Big Bang in the laboratory. One route to the answer -- which lies at the intersection between cosmology and materials science -- is to use laboratory materials to test the laws proposed for the formation of defects such as cosmic strings in the early universe. Here I will show that a popular multiferroic material, hexagonal yttrium manganite -- with its coexisting magnetic, ferroelectric and structural phase transitions -- generates the crystallographic equivalent of cosmic strings. I will describe how straightforward solution of the Schroedinger equation for yttrium manganite allows the important features of its behavior to be identified and quantified, and present experimental results of what seem to be the first unambiguous demonstration of the expected cosmological scaling laws in a real material. I will end with a plea for help with imaging the multiferroic \"cosmic strings\", and show some recent data suggesting that things might be less unambiguous than they seem. Klaus M\u00f8lmer, Aarhus University Quantum interactions with pulses of radiation abstract How does a quantum system interact with a travelling pulse of quantum radiation, prepared for example in a number state or a coherent state of light? While crucial for multiple effects in quantum optics and for the entire concept of flying and stationary qubits, quantum optics textbooks do not provide a formal description of this foundational and elementary interaction process. In this lecture, I shall introduce a new (and simple) master equation that describes the joint quantum state of travelling pulses of quantized radiation and local quantum systems. Applications of the theory will be presented for recent experiments with qubits and non-linear resonators interacting with pulses of optical, microwave and acoustic radiation. Ali Yazdani, Princeton University Strongly interacting electronic states of a moir\u00e9 superlattice abstract Interactions among electrons or the topology of their energy bands can create novel quantum phases of matter. The discovery of electronic bands with flat energy dispersion in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has created a unique opportunity to search for new correlated and topological electronic phases. From the initial discovery of correlated insulators, superconductivity, and more recent reports of topological phases in various transport studies it is clear that this is a very rich electronic system. To understand the underlying mechanisms for formation of various phases and their properties, we have carried out a series of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) studies of MATBG while tuning its carrier concentration with a gate. Such density-tuned STS studies can reveal a variety of key information that are impossible to obtain from other techniques. For example, in our first study, we showed that while the properties of the flat bands in MATBG can be understood with a weakly interacting picture when they are fully occupied or empty, at partial filling such models fails to understand their spectroscopic properties [1]. In a subsequent study, we showed that within this highly interacting states there are a cascade of transitions occurring as a function of carrier density, at each integer filling\u2014where insulating phases form at low temperatures [2]. We understand these transitions as a direct consequence of Coulomb interactions and spin/valley quantum degeneracy of this systems splitting the degenerate flat bands into Hubbard sub-bands. I will describe these studies as well as our ongoing efforts to probe the nature of insulating, topological, and superconducting states In MATBG using millikelvin STM measurements. Nurit Avraham, Weizmann Institute Multiple topological facets of Bismuth abstract Bismuth, due to its large spin-orbit coupling, plays a fundamental role in many topological materials. Yet the topological classification of pure Bismuth has remained, thus far, rather ambiguous. While some theoretical models indicate its trivial topological nature, other theoretical and experimental studies suggest non-trivial topological classifications, such as a strong or a higher order topological insulator. I will explain the origin for this ambiguity and present scanning tunneling microscopy data in which we resolve the topological classification of Bismuth, as a strong topological insulator with weak indices, by spectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary modes to a topological defect in the form of a screw dislocation [1]. Next, I will present our work on Bi\u2082TeI, which consists of a stack of Bi-bilayers. Our data shows that in this form the topological nature is of a dual topological insulator [2]. Bi 2 TeI hosts a weak topological insulator surface state on its \u2018side\u2019 facets and a topological crystalline insulator surface state protected by mirror symmetry on its top and bottom facets. We visualize the topological crystalline surface states and show their sensitivity to mirror symmetry-breaking as well as the one dimensional channels, derived from the 2D weak topological insulator states, which run along step-edges. We studied the coexistence of the two types of states on step-edges, where both facets join. Our measurements reveal that the two types of states remain well decoupled from one another due to separation in momentum space and in energy. We show, however, that this protection is susceptible to strong disorder. Nathalie de Leon, Princeton University Correlating surface spectroscopy with qubit measurements to systematically eliminate sources of noise abstract The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond exhibits spin-dependent fluorescence and long spin coherence times under ambient conditions, enabling applications in quantum information processing and sensing. NV centers near the surface can have strong interactions with external materials and spins, enabling new forms of nanoscale spectroscopy. However, NV spin coherence degrades within 100 nanometers of the surface, suggesting that diamond surfaces are plagued with ubiquitous defects. Prior work on characterizing near-surface noise has primarily relied on using NV centers themselves as probes; while this has the advantage of exquisite sensitivity, it provides only indirect information about the origin of the noise. I will describe our recent efforts to use X-ray and photoelectron spectroscopies, diffraction techniques, and morphology characterization to understand sources of noise at the diamond surface. By correlating this spectroscopic data with single spin measurements, we have been able to devise new surface processing and termination techniques to stabilize shallow NV centers within 5 nm of the surface with coherence times exceeding 100 \u03bcs (PRX 9, 031052, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.03...). Specifically, we are able to demonstrate reversible and reproducible control over the top layer of atoms. These highly coherent, shallow NV centers will provide a platform for sensing and imaging down to the scale of single atoms. In fact, many platforms for quantum technologies are limited by noise and loss arising from uncontrolled defects at surfaces and interfaces, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and semiconductor quantum dots. Our approach for correlating surface spectroscopy techniques with single qubit measurements to realize directed improvements is generally applicable to many systems, and I will describe our recent efforts to tackle noise and microwave losses in superconducting qubits. Building large, useful quantum systems based on transmon qubits will require significant improvements in qubit relaxation and coherence times, which are orders of magnitude shorter than limits imposed by bulk properties of the constituent materials. This indicates that relaxation likely originates from uncontrolled surfaces, interfaces, and contaminants. Previous efforts to improve qubit lifetimes have focused primarily on designs that minimize contributions from surfaces. However, significant improvements in the lifetime of two-dimensional transmon qubits have remained elusive for several years. We have fabricated two-dimensional transmon qubits that have both lifetimes and coherence times with dynamical decoupling exceeding 0.3 milliseconds by replacing niobium with tantalum in the device (arXiv:2003.00024, https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00024). We have observed increased lifetimes for many devices, indicating that these material improvements are robust, paving the way for higher gate fidelities in multi-qubit processors. Titus Neupert, University of Z\u00fcrich Exceptional Topological Insulators abstract Since their discovery, three-dimensional topological insulators have become the focal point for research on topological quantum matter. Their key feature are conducting surface states resembling a single species of gapless Dirac electrons. Transcending the realm of quantum matter, the topological insulator phase has since been realized in many different settings including metamaterials, such as photonic and phononic crystals. Most of such metamaterial platforms are accidentally or tunably lossy, such that their effective Hamiltonian description involves non-Hermitian terms due to the lack of energy conservation. The same holds for interacting electronic quantum systems in which quasiparticles attain a finite lifetime, for instance. Starting from the initial classification of topological matter based on Hermitian Hamiltonians, the study of systems with non-negligible loss and gain calls for an extension to non-Hermitian topological matter. In this colloquium, I will introduce the exceptional topological insulator (ETI), a three-dimensional non-Hermitian topological state of matter that features exotic non-Hermitian surface states which can only exist within the three-dimensional topological bulk embedding. I will show how this phase can evolve from a Weyl semimetal or Hermitian three-dimensional topological insulator close to criticality when quasiparticles acquire a finite lifetime. The ETI does not require any symmetry to be stabilized. It is characterized by a bulk energy point gap, and exhibits robust surface states that cover the bulk gap as a single sheet of complex eigenvalues or with a single surface exceptional point. The ETI can be induced in genuine solid-state and metamaterial systems, thereby setting a paradigm for non-Hermitian topological matter. Mohammad Hafezi, University of Maryland and JQI Quantum optics meets correlated electrons abstract One of the key challenges in the development of quantum technologies is the control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level where individual excitations matter. During the past couple of decades, there has been tremendous progress in controlling individual photons and other excitations such as spin, excitonic, phononic in solid-state systems. Such efforts have been motivated to develop quantum technologies such as quantum memories, quantum transducers, quantum networks, and quantum sensing. While these efforts have been mainly focused on control and manipulation of individual excitations (i.e., single-particle physics), both desired and undesired many-body effects have become important. Therefore, it is intriguing to explore whether these quantum optical control techniques could pave a radically new avenue to prepare, manipulate, and detect non-local and correlated electronic states, such as topological ones. We present several examples of such ideas: (1) Optically driven fractional quantum Hall states: While in Floquet band engineering, the focus is on the control of the single-particle Hamiltonian, here the optical drive can effectively engineer the interaction terms, which could lead to the preparation of model Hamiltonians and exotic topological states. (2) Enhancing superconductivity with an optical drive: we propose a new approach for the enhancement of superconductivity by the targeted destruction of the competing charge/bond density waves (BDW) order. By investigating the optical coupling of gapless, collective fluctuations of the BDWs, we argue that the resonant excitation of these modes can melt the underlying BDW order parameter. We propose an experimental setup to implement such an optical coupling using 2D plasmon-polariton hybrid systems. (3) We also discuss how the coupling of an empty cavity can enhance the superconducting transition temperature, in a quantum analogy to the Eliasberg effect. In the end, we discuss how by driving a semi-conductor and creating a population inversion, one could achieve s-wave and p-wave superconducting pairing. Michel Devoret, Yale University An error-corrected logical quantum bit encoded in grid states of a superconducting cavity abstract The accuracy of logical operations on quantum bits (qubits) must be improved for quantum computers to surpass classical ones in useful tasks. To do so, quantum information must be robust to noise that affects the underlying physical system. Rather than suppressing noise, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) aims at preventing it from causing logical errors. This approach derives from the reasonable assumption that noise is local: it does not act in a coordinated way on different parts of the physical system. Therefore, if a logical qubit is encoded non-locally, we can, during a limited time, detect and correct noise-induced evolution before it corrupts the encoded information. In 2001, Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill (GKP) proposed a hardware-efficient instance of such a non-local qubit, which is based on superpositions of position states in a single oscillator. However, implementing measurements that reveal error syndromes of the oscillator while preserving the encoded information was considered experimentally challenging: the only realization so far relied on post-selection, which is incompatible with quantum error correction. The novelty of our experiment [1] is precisely that it implements these non-destructive error-syndrome measurements, the oscillator role being played by a superconducting microwave cavity. Moreover, we have designed and implemented an original feedback protocol that incorporates such measurements to prepare square and hexagonal GKP code states. We then demonstrated QEC of an encoded qubit with the unprecedented suppression of all logical errors, in quantitative agreement with a theoretical estimate based on the measured imperfections of the experiment. Our protocol is applicable to other continuous variable systems and can mitigate logical errors generated by a wide variety of noise processes.

Pedram Roushan, Google AI Quantum Tuning quantum information scrambling in two-dimensional systems abstract The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor. In 2019, we reported the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times\u2014our benchmarks indicate that the equivalent task for a classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. Established quantum supremacy, we now take a closer look at how quantum information scrambling takes place and computational complexity grows. We demonstrate that the complexity of quantum circuits is directly revealed through measurements of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which capture the spatial-temporal spread of local perturbations. We implement a variety of quantum circuits ranging from simple integrable circuits such as XY model in 1D to fully ergotic circuits such as 2D random circuits. Our protocol effectively separates scrambling from gate-error induced noise, allowing us to distinguish the complexity of these circuits. We image the dispersion of the scrambling wavefront as it changes from diffusive to ballistic propagation, resulting from changing the entangling gates. By tuning away from the Clifford gate set, we break integrability and dial-in ergodicity and distinguish these complexity classes from their fluctuation signatures. Our work establishes OTOC as a tool to visualize scrambling and diagnose complexity in time and size scales that are challenging to access classically. Brian Skinner, Ohio State University Measurement-induced Phase Transitions in the Dynamics of Quantum Entanglement abstract When a quantum system evolves under unitary dynamics, as produced by either a Hamiltonian or by a sequence of quantum gates, its various component parts tend to become more entangled with each other. Making measurements, on the other hand, tends to reduce this entanglement by collapsing some of the system's degrees of freedom. In this talk we explore what happens to the entanglement when a quantum many-body system undergoes both unitary evolution and sporadic measurements. We show that the competition between these two effects leads to a new kind of dynamical phase transition, such that when the measurement rate is lower than a critical value the dynamics is \"entangling\", while a higher-than-critical measurement rate leads to a \"disentangling\" phase. We study this transition both in one-dimensional spin chains and in \"all-to-all\" coupled systems, for which unitary operators can directly couple any two degrees of freedom. In both cases the qualitative features of the transition can be understood by mapping to a problem of classical percolation, and in the all-to-all case some features of the transition can be understood exactly. Natalia Ares, Oxford University Measuring and tuning quantum devices faster than human experts abstract Machine learning has been the enabler of well-known breakthroughs in computer science, such as the victory of Alpha Go over a Go world champion and superhuman face recognition. I will show you how we can direct this great potential to the characterisation and tuning of quantum devices in real time. As in Go, where a player must carefully balance short and long-term goals and devise actions accordingly, we have demonstrated a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that devises efficient policies to find desired measurement features. Our algorithm divides the parameter space of a semiconductor quantum device in blocks, and finds target measurement features by performing a minimum number of block measurements. In this way, we reduce the long characterisation times required due to device variability. We have also developed an algorithm that measures bias triangles, important features for qubit operation, and gives them a score. The device parameters are then updated to optimise this score in real-time. The algorithm, using a disentangling variational auto-encoder, proves capable of fine-tuning several device parameters at once. Finally, I will show you an algorithm that can tune a \u2018virgin\u2019 double quantum dot device to operation conditions in real time faster than human experts and without the need of specifying a device architecture. These approaches are widely applicable, opening the way to a completely automatic and efficient route to quantum device measurement and tuning, and thus taking a crucial step towards the scalability of quantum circuits. Jennifer Cano, Stony Brook University Higher magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene and topological twistronics abstract We present recent analytical and numerical results on the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene and introduce a new platform for twistronic devices on the surface of a topological insulator. In the first part of the talk, we study the flat band wavefunctions of chiral twisted bilayer graphene at higher magic angles. We show that at higher magic angles, the wavefunctions exhibit an increasing number of zeros, resembling quantum Hall wavefunctions at higher Landau levels. Zeros of the same chirality cluster near the center of the moire unit cell, causing an enhanced phase winding and circulating current. The wavefunctions at higher magic angles have signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy and orbital magnetization experiments. In the second half of the talk, we investigate the fate of the surface Dirac cone of a three-dimensional topological insulator subject to a superlattice potential. Using a combination of diagrammatic perturbation theory, lattice model simulations, and ab initio calculations, we report a dramatic renormalization of the surface Dirac cone velocity and the formation of gapless satellite Dirac cones. The latter can produce very flat bands that may be a fruitful place to searching for interaction-driven physics. Deji Akinwande, University of Texas at Austin 2D materials: From atoms to applications abstract This talk will present our latest research adventures on 2D nanomaterials towards greater scientific understanding and advanced engineering applications. In particular, the talk will highlight our work on flexible electronics, zero-power devices, monolayer memory (atomristors), non-volatile RF switches, and wearable tattoo sensors. Non-volatile memory devices based on 2D materials represent an application of defects and are a rapidly advancing field with rich physics that can be attributed to sulfur vacancies or metal diffusion. Atomistic modeling and atomic-resolution imaging are contemporary tools used to elucidate the memory phenomena in these systems. Likewise, from a practical point of view, electronic tattoos based on graphene have ushered a new material platform that has highly desirable practical attributes including optical transparency, mechanical imperceptibility, and is the thinnest conductive electrode sensor that can be integrated on skin for physiological measurements.","title":"Long Range Colloquium 2020"},{"location":"long_range_colloquium-2021/","text":"Long Range Colloquium The Long Range Colloquium is a bi-weekly seminar series covering the latest developments in condensed matter physics and quantum information.

In this talk, I will discuss how odd matter\u2014in which microscopic interactions are asymmetric and non-conservative\u2014can be used to steer mechanical waves in unprecedented ways. Combining experiments on mechanical lattices of distributed robots with wave physics and continuum and topological mechanics, I will discuss the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect, of non-Hermitian topological waves and of one-way solitons. I will further show how these odd waves can be used to induce locomotion and unusual responses to impacts and hence pave the way towards a novel generation of materials with animate properties.

By David Goldhaber-Gordon (Stanford University), November 10 18:30 UTC Abstract Video recording When we speak of a quantum computer today, we usually mean one that can run any algorithm. But the idea of using a quantum-based computer to simulate aspects of our quantum world goes back at least to Feynman in the early 1980s. Effective model Hamiltonians are central to condensed matter physics, as they can capture the essence of material properties while avoiding the full complexity of actual materials. But even those model Hamiltonians can be intractable to treat on classical computers. Very perfect realizations of model Hamiltonians relevant to materials can now be built with ensembles of cold atoms or with nanopatterned solid state systems similar to those used to make qubits. I will compare new experimental results to cutting-edge classical computation, and then ask: What happens when we (soon!) get our wish and achieve a \"quantum simulator\" that can describe certain interesting Hamiltonians with power beyond the best classical computers and algorithms? MBL-mobile: Many-body-localized engine By Nicole Yunger Halpern (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Joint Institute for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS) University of Maryland), October 27 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Many-body-localized (MBL) systems do not thermalize under their intrinsic dynamics. The athermality of MBL, we propose, can be harnessed for thermodynamic tasks. We illustrate this ability by formulating an Otto engine cycle for a quantum many-body system. The system is ramped between a strongly localized MBL regime and a thermal (or weakly localized) regime. The difference between the energy-level correlations of MBL systems and of thermal systems enables mesoscale engines to run in parallel in the thermodynamic limit, enhances the engine\u2019s reliability, and suppresses worst-case trials. We estimate analytically and calculate numerically the engine\u2019s efficiency and per-cycle power. The efficiency mirrors the efficiency of the conventional thermodynamic Otto engine. This work introduces a thermodynamic lens onto MBL, which, having been studied much recently, can now be leveraged in thermodynamic tasks.

Our measurements provide a direct evidence that the electrons at densities < 3 \u00b7 10^11 cm-2 in a pristine MoSe2 monolayer form a Wigner crystal even at B = 0. This is revealed by our low-temperature (T = 80 mK) magneto-optical spectroscopy experiments that utilize a newly developed technique allowing to unequivocally detect charge order in an electronic Mott-insulator state. This method relies on the modification of excitonic band structure arising due to the periodic potential experienced by the excitons interacting with a crystalline electronic lattice. Under such conditions, optically-inactive exciton states with finite momentum matching the reciprocal Wigner lattice vector k = k\u00adW get Bragg scattered back to the light cone, where they hybridize with the zero-momentum bright exciton states. This leads to emergence of a new, umklapp peak in the optical spectrum heralding the presence of periodically-ordered electronic lattice. Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in the Magnetic Topological Insulator Thin Films By Cui-Zu Chang (Pennsylvania State University), September 29 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be considered as the quantum Hall (QH) effect without an external magnetic field, which can be realized by time-reversal symmetry breaking in a topologically non-trivial system [1, 2]. A QAH system carries spin-polarized dissipationless chiral edge transport channels without the need for external energy input, hence may have a huge impact on future electronic and spintronic device applications for ultralow-power consumption. The many decades' quest for the experimental realization of the QAH phenomenon became a possibility in 2006 with the discovery of topological insulators (TIs). In 2013, the QAH effect was observed in thin films of Cr-doped TI for the first time [3]. Two years later in a near-ideal system, V-doped TI, contrary to the negative prediction from first principle calculations [2], a high-precision QAH quantization with more robust magnetization and a perfectly dissipationless chiral current flow was demonstrated [4]. In this talk, I will introduce the route to the experimental observation of the QAH effect in the aforementioned two systems [3, 4], and also talk about our recent progress on the high Chern number QAH effect in magnetic TI multilayers [5].

Ultrafast control of magnetic interactions via light-driven phonons By Andrea Caviglia (Delft University of Technology), September 15 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Resonant ultrafast excitation of infrared-active phonons is a powerful technique with which to control the electronic properties of materials that leads to remarkable phenomena such as light-induced superconductivity, switching of ferroelectric polarization and ultrafast insulator-to-metal transitions. We will discuss how light-driven phonons can be utilized to coherently manipulate macroscopic magnetic states. Intense mid-infrared electric field pulses tuned to resonance with a phonon mode of the archetypical antiferromagnet DyFeO3 induce ultrafast and long-living changes of the fundamental exchange interaction between rare-earth orbitals and transition metal spins. Non-thermal lattice control of the magnetic exchange, which defines the stability of the macroscopic magnetic state, allows us to perform picosecond coherent switching between competing antiferromagnetic and weakly ferromagnetic spin orders. In this talk, the potential of resonant phonon excitation for the manipulation of ferroic order on ultrafast timescales will be emphasized. Provably efficient machine learning for quantum many-body problems By Richard Kueng (Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria), September 1 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Classical machine learning (ML) provides a potentially powerful approach to solving challenging problems in quantum physics and chemistry. However, the advantages of ML over more traditional methods have not been firmly established. We prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently predict ground state properties of a physical system, after learning from data obtained by measuring related systems. We also prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter. Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct classical description of a quantum state that can be constructed in feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the state. This is joint work with Robert Huang (Caltech), Giacomo Torlai (AWS), Victor Albert (University of Maryland) and John Preskill (Caltech+AWS). Topological Mechanics By Sebastian Huber (ETH Zurich), June 23 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Topological band theory provides us with a powerful design-principle for metamaterials that control how waves propagate in space. These metamaterials are ideal to investigate novel phenomena difficult to observe in other platforms. In particular, I will present how artificial gauge fields lead to the appearance of chiral Landau levels in neutral Weyl systems and crystalline symmetries to novel fragile topological states in an acoustic super-structure. Predicting and Controlling Scalable Quantum Systems By Prineha Narang (Harvard University), June 9 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Quantum matter hosts spectacular excited-state and nonequilibrium effects, but many of these phenomena remain challenging to control and, consequently, technologically underexplored. My group\u2019s research, therefore, focuses on how quantum systems behave, particularly away from equilibrium, and how we can harness these effects. By creating predictive theoretical and computational approaches to study dynamics, decoherence and correlations in quantum matter, our work could enable technologies that are inherently more powerful than their classical counterparts ranging from scalable quantum information processing and networks, to ultra-high efficiency optoelectronic and energy conversion systems (1). In this talk, I will present work from my research group on describing, from first principles, the microscopic dynamics, decoherence and optically-excited collective phenomena in quantum matter at finite temperature to quantitatively link predictions with 3D atomic-scale imaging and quantum spectroscopy. Capturing these dynamics poses unique theoretical and computational challenges. The simultaneous contribution of processes that occur on many time and length-scales have remained elusive for state-of-the-art calculations and model Hamiltonian approaches alike, necessitating the development of new methods in computational physics (2\u20134). I will show selected examples of our approach in ab initio design of active defects in quantum materials (5\u20137), and control of collective phenomena to link these active defects (8\u201310). Finally, I will discuss ideas in directly emulating quantum information systems, particularly addressing the issues of model abstraction and scalability, and present an outlook on various co-design strategies with algorithms efforts underway.

Many-body wave functions in the era of machine learning and quantum computing By Giuseppe Carleo (EPFL Lausanne), May 26 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording The theoretical description of several complex quantum phenomena fundamentally relies on many-particle wave functions and our ability to represent and manipulate them. Variational methods aim at compact descriptions of many-body wave functions in terms of parameterised ansatz states, and are at present living exciting transformative developments, thanks to advances both in machine learning and in quantum computing. In this talk I will first present variational representations of quantum states based on artificial neural networks [1]. Highlighting the connection with other known representations based on tensor networks [2], I will also discuss the crucial role of physical symmetries in these representations. Then, I will discuss parameterised quantum circuits, and hybrid classical-quantum variational schemes with an emphasis on near-term quantum hardware and limited-depth circuits. In this context, I will discuss strategies to efficiently target ground-state problems [3] and unitary dynamics [4]. For both classical and quantum variational parameterisations, I will focus on physics-oriented applications of these approaches, discussing their limitations and possible paths for improvement. \u2014\u2014\u2014 [1] Carleo and Troyer, Science 365, 602 (2017) [2] Sharir, Shashua, and Carleo, arXiv:2103.10293 (2021) [3] Stokes, Izaac, Killoran, and Carleo, Quantum 4, 269 (2020) [4] Barison, Vicentini, and Carleo, arXiv:2101.04579 (2021) When Photons Self-Organize: Making Matter from Light By Jonathan Simon (University of Chicago), May 12 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording In this talk I will discuss ongoing efforts at University of Chicago to explore matter made of light. I will begin with a broad introduction to the challenges associated with making matter from photons, focusing specifically on (1) how to trap photons and imbue them with synthetic mass and charge; (2) how to induce photons to collide with one another; and (3) how to drive photons to order, by cooling or otherwise. I will then provide as examples two state-of-the-art photonic quantum matter platforms: microwave photons coupled to superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, and optical photons trapped in multimode optical cavities and made to interact through Rydberg-dressing. In each case I will describe a synthetic material created in that platform: a Mott insulator of microwave photons, stabilized by coupling to an engineered, non-Markovian reservoir, and a Laughlin molecule of optical photons prepared by scattering photons through the optical cavity. I will conclude with an outlook on new experimental platforms we are developing to marry these techniques and ideas! Cavity quantum materials By Michael Sentef (Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter), April 28 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Recent years have seen tremendous progress in utilizing ultrafast light-matter interaction to control the macroscopic properties of quantum materials [1]. Many of the most intriguing effects are based on nonthermal pathways, with the material (quantum many-body system) being driven away from its thermal equilibrium by strong laser pulses. While this has deepened our understanding of quantum matter far from equilibrium and enabled us to build bridges to other fields (quantum simulators, Floquet states of matter, (pre)thermalization, \u2026), there are a number of challenges: (i) the need for strong lasers, (ii) heating, (iii) short lifetime of light-induced states. This has motivated an emergent community of researchers to search for new directions that draw inspiration from the discoveries in ultrafast materials science and combine them with expertise gleaned from quantum optics, cavity QED, polaritonic chemistry, and nanoplasmonics, creating the new field of \"cavity quantum materials\u201c. In this Colloquium, I will provide a personal perspective on this new field and highlight a few of our recent works. Specifically, I will discuss the quantum-to-classical crossover of Floquet engineering in correlated systems and show how a many-photon classical coherent state can be replaced by a few-photon number state, provided that one can reach the regime of sufficiently strong light-matter coupling in a cavity [2]. I will then show how the quantum geometry of wavefunctions impacts their light-matter coupling, and how we envision this to be a key ingredient for future light-matter-based engineering of flat-band (Moir\u00e9) materials [3].

It is one of the approaches which has the potential to address the ever-growing need of society, industry and research for computing power. At ETH Zurich, we have designed, realized and tested a first data link which allows superconducting-circuit-based quantum processors located in different systems to directly exchange quantum information [1]. This link, for a quantum computer, takes the role of a network transferring data between computing nodes located in a high-performance computing data center. However, unlike its conventional counterparts, our data link is operated at ultra-low temperatures, close to the absolute zero. This allows our quantum data link to directly connect to quantum processors operating at the same temperature [2]. The system we have constructed is a first of its kind in the world and could play an important role in growing the power of quantum computers in the future. [1] P. Magnard et al., Phys. Rev.

Kurpiers et al., Nature 558, 264-267 (2018) Benefits of good old-fashioned crystalline perfection - new physics in ultra pure delafossite metals By Andrew Mackenzie (Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids), March 31 17:30 UTC Abstract Video recording The delafossites are a series of layered compounds with triangular lattices similar to that of NaCoO2 but with a different stacking sequence along the c axis. They are host to intriguing magnetic insulators and semimetals, as well as metals such as PdCoO2, PtCoO2, PdCrO2 and PdRhO2. The properties of these metals are remarkable. Although they are strongly two-dimensional, their room temperature electrical conductivity is higher per carrier than that of any elemental metal, and PdCoO2 crystals can have a low temperature resistivity of only a few n\u03a9cm, corresponding to mean free paths of tens of microns. I will describe recent experiments from my group in which we have established that the huge mean free paths result from extraordinarily low defect densities in the conducting planes of as-grown crystals, and give examples of new mesoscopic physics that can be observed as a result. If time permits I will also discuss intriguing bulk and surface states that can be observed with extremely high resolution in angle resolved photoemission experiments. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices out-of-equilibrium By Monika Aidelsburger (Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich), March 3 18:30 UTC Abstract Video recording Well-controlled synthetic quantum systems, such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offer intriguing possibilities to study complex many-body problems relevant to a variety of research areas, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. In particular, out-of-equilibrium phenomena constitute natural applications of quantum simulators, which have already successfully demonstrated simulations in regimes that are beyond reach using state-of-the-art numerical techniques. This enables us to shed new light on fundamental questions about the thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. While generic models are expected to thermalize according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), violation of ETH is believed to occur mainly in two types of systems: integrable models and many-body localized systems. In between these two extreme limits there is, however, a whole range of models that exhibit more complex dynamics, for instance, due to an emergent fragmentation of the Hilbert space into many dynamically disconnected subspaces. Here, we realize such a model by implementing the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model with a strong linear potential [1] and observe strong initial-state dependent thermalization - a smoking-gun signature of Hilbert-space fragmentation. Engineering quantum systems out-of-equilibrium, on the other hand, further can be used as a tool to engineer novel quantum phases of matter, which cannot be accessed in static realizations. To this end, the system\u2019s parameters are varied periodically, a method commonly known as Floquet engineering [2]. This facilitated the realization of paradigmatic topological lattice models and recently inspired ideas for implementing Z2 lattice gauge theories [3]. The rich properties of topological Floquet systems, however, transcend those of their static counterparts, resulting in a generalized bulk-edge correspondence. As a consequence, topological edge modes can exist even in situations where the bulk bands have zero Chern numbers. The novel properties of such anomalous Floquet systems open the door to exciting new non- equilibrium many-body phases without any static analogue [4]. [1] S.

It has recently been discovered in various lattice models, tensor gauge theories, etc. In this talk, we discuss how another powerful field theory framework -- the 2+1D Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory -- can be used to provide new insight and explore new possibilities in 3+1D fracton order. 2+1D U(1) gauge theories with a CS term provide a simple and complete characterization of 2+1D Abelian topological orders. To study 3+1D fracton order, we extend the theory by taking the number of component gauge fields to be infinity. In the simplest case of infinite-component CS gauge theory, different components do not couple to each other and the theory describes a decoupled stack of 2+1D fractional Quantum Hall systems with quasi-particles moving only in 2D planes -- hence a fractonic system. More interestingly, we find that when the component gauge fields do couple through the CS term, more varieties of fractonic orders are possible. For example, they may describe foliated fractonic systems which extends the framework found in exactly solvable models. Moreover, we find examples which lie beyond the foliation framework, characterized by 2D excitations of infinite order and braiding statistics that are not strictly local. Orbital magnetism in graphene heterostructures By Andrea Young (UCSB), February 3 18:30 UTC Abstract Video recording The earliest reports of ferromagnetism date to Thales of Miletus who lived and wrote around 600 BC. Thales noted the ability of natural magnetite to attract iron, and is said to have taken this as proof that matter itself was alive. Our theories of magnetism have evolved considerably since then: we now know that ferromagnetism arises from the interplay of the Coulomb repulsion between electrons and their fermionic statistics. However, in one sense our science has advanced only little: the vast majority of magnets, like magnetite, consist of ordered arrangements of the electron spins stabilized by the spin orbit interaction. In my talk, I will describe a new class of magnets based on the spontaneous alignment of electron orbitals. Such orbital ferromagnetism may be a generic phenomena, but has, to date, found its fullest expression in graphene heterostructures in which the two dimensional orbits of electrons in distinct momentum space valleys provide the underlying degree of freedom. Because orbital degrees of freedom arise directly from the band wavefunctions, they are uniquely susceptible to experimental control via materials design. Orbital magnets also enable new forms of magnetic control using in situ knobs. For instance, orbital magnets in moire superlattice systems, where the band structure features nontrivial topology, allow for field-effect switching of magnetic moments and the resulting quantized anomalous Hall effects. I will conclude with an outlook for realizing more exotic topological phases of matter based on orbital magnetism. \u200cElectrons Bloch-waltzing in Moire superlattices By Leonid Levitov (MIT), January 20 18:30 UTC Abstract A striking prediction of the quantum theory of solids is that Bloch electrons in the presence of a constant electric field oscillate at a frequency tunable by the field and taking identical values for all carriers in the band. As a paradigmatic example of collective electron dynamics, Bloch oscillations received much attention, and yet, achieving this regime in solids proved to be challenging. This talk will discuss the new ideas and a new hope triggered by the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, in particular the flat bands in Moire graphene. There are several interesting not-yet-explored regimes harbored by these systems. One is synchronous oscillations of \u201cenlightened\u201d electrons coupled to \u201cthe big power in the sky\u201d (the EM field of a proximal resonator)\u2014a collective many-body dynamics that holds promise for THz electronics. Another is magnetic Bloch oscillations achieved by combining constant electric and magnetic fields. The unique dynamical regimes arising in this case are described by the Ashcroft-Mermin (AM) Hamiltonian. We will demonstrate that the AM dynamics is integrable and identify two distinct phases, electric and magnetic, exhibiting position-momentum duality\u2014the orbits extended in the \\(k\\) space and confined in the \\(x\\) space, and vice versa. The boundary between the electric and magnetic phases hosts an interesting and presently poorly understood chaotic dynamical phase. The two phases\u2014electric and magnetic\u2014are of keen interest both as examples of complex quantum dynamics arising in a simple setting and because of their relevance for THz research.","title":"Long Range Colloquium 2021"},{"location":"mailinglist/","text":"Sign Up Please fill in this form and select the mailing lists you would like to join. \u00d7 Name Email Mailing lists General mailing list Speakers' Corner mailing list Sign Up","title":"Mailinglist"},{"location":"moderatorguide/","text":"Moderator Guide Your tasks ensure that the person recording the event has a screen resolution equal to or lower than 1920x1080. open the program by introducing the event, organizers and the (first) speaker remind the audience of the event format and explain how and when to ask questions monitor the participant list for raised hands and enable those attendees to ask questions handle any technical issues monitor participant behavior, including in the chat, for breaches of the code of conduct give a closing remarks The moderator role requires full concentration and continuous monitoring of multiple channels. In that sense, moderating an online event is significantly more demanding than the role of a chair in an offline conference. Below we provide more detailed information on certain aspects of the moderator role, including instructions specific to the Zoom platform where applicable. How to Opening and closing remarks At the beginning of the seminar: ensure that everyone is muted and cannot unmute themselves: checkmark the \"mute all participants\" checkbox and uncheck the \"participants may unmute themselves\" checkbox remind the audience that the talk is recorded and start the recording deliver the opening remarks, introduce VSF and the speaker, remind the audience about the Q/A format and to please report any technical issues to you turn on spotlight of the speaker\u2019s webcam stream unmute the speaker and invite them to begin their seminar At the end of the seminar: thank the speaker initiate the post-talk question/answer period turn off spotlighting speaker's webcam stream NB: a virtual conference cannot have applause after the seminar ends! However, you may invite the audience to use alternatives such as the Zoom \"applaud\" emote. Question guidelines Our suggested guidelines for when questions are allowed: * short talks: after the talk ends * long talks: questions may be asked at any time Mediating questions: monitor the participants list to observe attendees signaling for questions (\u201craise hand\u201d Zoom emote) inform the speaker and audience of the question and signal the asker by stating their name and unmuting their microphone leave the asker unmuted while interacting with the speaker mute the asker when finished and \u201clower their hand\u201d in the event of a prolonged discussion get the talk back on track and suggest a private discussion after the seminar Technical issues speaker-side issues: where possible, try to have a second line of communication with the speakers in case an issue comes up on their end audience-side issues: attendees are instructed to send chat messages directly to the moderator if technical issues arise on their end, and the moderator must make a judgement call as to whether some kind of action should be taken Moderators should report any technical issues (and fixes) to the organizers and the VSF team and also encourage such feedback from all participants. Misconduct In the event of misconduct by any participant in video, audio, or text chat, moderators need to take the following actions (in order): warn involved participant(s) of their behaviour and the possible consequences remove repeat offenders from the session","title":"Moderator Guide"},{"location":"organizerguide/","text":"Organizer Guide So, you are thinking of organizing a short virtual event. This is easy, rewarding, and takes little work. This manual will guide you through the process. Bird\u2019s eye view of what it takes Here is a short summary of all the steps you will need to take Build a team of organizers Decide on a recent and exciting topic Write a brief description of the event Decide on the scale/format of the event. Some things to consider: length of the event number of talks whether to have only invited talks or also contributed talks whether to have a poster session whether to have meeting with speakers (especially useful to students and junior scientists) Make a list of possible speakers to approach Decide on a date (should be at least 2 months in the future, so that you can find the speakers and announce the event properly) Submit an application to us Approach the speakers, invite submissions for the contributed talks (if you have them) and start making a program Find the moderators for the talks Advertise the event Build a webpage / create a registration and if applicable abstract submission form. Email the Zoom link to the registered participants one or two days before the event Test the software with the moderators and speakers the day before the event Run the event and have fun! Basic facts We find that the best format is an event of up to 3 hours in a single day. However, for conferences or schools there is also the option of having a few talks per day over several days (but make sure not to make the program too heavy!). One timeslot can suit only two timezones: America/Europe, Europe/Asia or Asia/America. You can use this website to find the timeslot that best suits your needs. Both conventional conference talks of up to one hour (including questions), and 10-15 minute talks work well. We require that all the videos are recorded and published on the website after the event. Application form Apply via a github issue here (requires a github.com account). Detailed instructions Planning and application: two months before the event Build an organizer team of 2--4 people. Since you will be inviting the speakers and the audience, your team should have good connections in the community. It is also a good idea to find organizers from more than one research group/university. Decide on the topic of the event. We strongly recommend to focus on recent developments: these make it easier to attract an audience, and you benefit from a shorter waiting period until the conference. Choose a name for your event. Write a brief explanation of what the topic is, and why it is important. This will eventually go on the event's webpage, so try and make it clean and attractive. If possible, prepare an image to go along with the description. Make a list of prospective speakers that you plan to approach. Make sure you have a good gender, geographical and seniority balance in your speaker list! Choose a date and time slot for your event. Try to avoid conflicts with conferences on related topics, major holidays, etc. Finally, submit this information to the VSF. At this stage we aim to accept all applications after basic review (unless the demand is overwhelming). Reaching out to speakers: at least 6 weeks before the event Once we approve your application and reserved your time slot, you and your co-organizers can start contacting the speakers. You should aim to secure your speakers at least one month prior to your event. Finalizing and announcing: at least 4 weeks before the event Once your program is complete, we will prepare a page for your event on the VSF website and a registration form for the participants. Now you can start advertising your event. We will announce the event to anyone signed up to our mailing list and publicly through our Twitter account, but since you have connections in your specific community, the most effective advertising will come from you. Use your resources. For example you can consider: Announcing the event to your colleagues via email Posting about it on social media We of course ask you to be considerate and avoid spamming your colleagues. Final preparation: 1 week before the event In the virtual conference setting, moderators play a vital role. Find moderators for your event. The moderator's role is demanding, and we recommend finding more than one person to fill it. For example, you might want to have one person in charge of introducing the speakers and moderate the question, and a second one checking who want to asks questions and making sure everything is running smoothly. See our Moderator Guide for more detailed information. Set up an appointment with the speakers and the moderators to introduce them to the platform. During the event Make final technical checks shortly before the event starts. By this time you, the moderators, and the speakers should know how the platform works (it\u2019s easy, but requires some preparation). Remind the person recording the event to set their screen resolution to 1920x1080 or lower in order for the recording to render properly (otherwise the speaker's video stream will be tiny). Give a brief opening and closing speech. In the opening speech, introduce the event, and remind participants of the code of conduct. After the event Review the event page adding the recordings of the talks. If you like, add any concluding remarks to the page content. VSF is a newly developed platform, and we welcome your feedback and overall evaluation of your experience. Please write a short summary with your thoughts and suggestions: what worked well, what didn\u2019t, and what would you like to improve. Conclusion That\u2019s all it takes. Let us know if you have any questions, and we\u2019re looking forward to hosting your event!","title":"Organizer Guide"},{"location":"privacy_policy/","text":"Privacy policy Our goal at the Virtual Science Forum (VSF) is to handle your information transparently and in a maximally secure and private way.

The workshop took place March 2, 2023. The videos are available below. During the last decade, the social and biomedical sciences have been grappling with a \u201creplication crisis,\u201d in which a large fraction of published results cannot be verified or reproduced. The causes and solutions to this replication crisis are still not entirely clear, but generally its roots involve publication bias, the predominance of trendy research narratives, and unreliable or fraudulent manipulation of data. Condensed matter physics, as a field, has largely been considered immune to replication crises by its practitioners, since its experiments tend to be data-rich as compared to those in the social or biomedical sciences. But many of the same root problems are also prevalent in condensed matter, so it is both reasonable and timely to consider the questions: do we need to worry about a replication crisis coming for us? Is it already here? In this short workshop we will review the replication crisis as it has arisen in the social and medical sciences, then consider a few case studies of prominent recent results in condensed matter that have proven unreliable, and close with a panel discussion.

If you can arrange two screens, so that you use one for your presentation, and the other to view the audience, it may help get some visual feedback. Make sure your microphone produces good sound quality, if not, try to find a good external microphone. Ensure that the person recording the event has a screen resolution equal to or lower than 1920x1080 (otherwise Zoom will render the speaker's video stream to be tiny). One day before your seminar you will be provided with a link to a testing area on our virtual conferencing platform (currently Zoom). Connect and test your video, audio, microphone, the display of your presentation, etc. Become familiar with the different screen-sharing options (share a specific screen, share particular program window, etc) to be prepared to choose the correct one. The day of your seminar join the meeting at least 10 minutes before the start of your talk. Don't forget to disable annotations by other participants. Make sure to turn off any programs that would result in pop-up or sound notifications during your talk. This can include email software, any chat programs (Slack, Google chat, gitter, etc), VOIP software (Skype, etc), or other ones as well like Dropbox. Also turn off any unncessary backgound programs (such as browser with many open tabs), as this can affect the quality of your video stream. Disable smooth inter-slide transitions and slow animations in the presentation. Because of low frame rate, they work poorly. Audience questions At the beginning of the seminar the moderators will announce the format for asking questions. Visit moderator guide for further information. During your seminar, you will be the only person whose microphone will be continuously streamed to the audience. In general, only moderators are allowed to mute/unmute participants, including you. Attendees will notify the moderators when they have questions. The moderators will, at their discretion, unmute themselves to stop the presentation, and then unmute the audience member allowing for questions and direct interaction with you. Since the moderator needs to interrupt you to allow for questions, it is generally a good idea to pause for 5-10 seconds from time to time to introduce an opportunity for the possible questions. Unlike during a regular conference, you will have no option to chat informally after your talk. To compensate for that, we invite you to tell the audience how they can reach you afterwards. Recommendations In a virtual seminar it is possible to use multiple software platforms as part of your presentation. To make it more dynamical and visual you can share a Jupyter/Mathematica notebook and live-show code/software that you developed. On a computer setup with a touchscreen and digital pen, it is possible to do \u201cchalk talk\u201d style presentation. This can be either an intended part of your talk or a way to answer questions. Have the software and hardware ready to go so that it can be easily put to use when needed. Considerations for the recording of your talk Bear in mind that your talk will be recorded via the Zoom platform. You should also be aware that the participants may take screenshots/their own recordings during your talk. You can review the recording and request removal of some segments before it is published on Youtube. Since the recording will be published, images that were simply grabbed from the internet should not be included. We recommend to use either Google image search with the copyright filter turned on or Wikimedia Commons. Conduct Hostile, disruptive, or disrespectful behaviour is monitored by the moderators. The moderators will remove participants violating professional conduct.","title":"Speaker Guide"},{"location":"speakers-corner-header/","text":"Speakers' Corner Named after the renowned corner of Hyde Park in London, the Speakers' Corner seminars are a platform for everyone who would like to share their research.

Mert Bozkurt (TU Delft, Quantum Tinkerer), November 14 15:00 UTC ** We present a systematic method to design arbitrary energy-phase relations using parallel arms of two series Josephson tunnel junctions each. Our approach employs Fourier engineering in the energy-phase relation of each arm and the position of the arms in real space. We demonstrate our method by engineering the energy-phase relation of a near-ideal superconducting diode, which we find to be robust against the imperfections in the design parameters. Finally, we show the versatility of our approach by designing various other energy-phase relations. Authors: A. Mert Bozkurt, Jasper Brookman, Valla Fatemi, Anton R.

The fourfold degenerate bands near charge neutrality feature Dirac fermions, and experiments have observed an effect known as the \u201cDirac revival\u201d: at integer values of \\(\\ nu\\) the density \u2018resets\u2019 to the charge neutrality point, so the system is described by a Dirac theory even away from charge neutrality. In this talk I will describe a theoretical proposal in which these revived Dirac fermions have a small velocity, so that their dispersion is approximately quadratic in a range of energies. The quadratic Dirac fermions result in a logarithmic enhancement of interaction effects, which does not appear for a linear dispersion. The resulting non-trivial RG flow produces nematic and insulating states near integer fillings, which give way to superconducting states past a critical relative doping, and predicts phases which resolve several experimental puzzles \u2014 producing T-IVC insulating states for repulsive interactions, explaining the results of very recent STM experiments, alongside nodal \\(A_2\\) superconductivity near \\(\\nu=2\\) , whose properties can explain puzzles in tunnelling studies of the superconducting state. The model also explains why superconductivity is generally not observed when TBG is aligned with an hBN substrate, why superconductivity is less robust near \\(\\nu=0\\) and 1 than \\(\\nu=2\\) , the asymmetry of the phase diagram between electron and hole doping, and the transition from a gapless to gapped charge neutrality point as a function of strain seen in STM \u2014 unifying many aspects of the phase diagram with a single theoretical model. Exact solution for the filling-induced thermalization transition in a 1D fracton system By Brian Skinner (Ohio State) Details Video recording Authors: Calvin Pozderac, Steven Speck, Xiaozhou Feng, David A. Huse, Brian Skinner Preprint: arXiv:2210.02469 We study a random circuit model of constrained fracton dynamics, in which particles on a one-dimensional lattice undergo random local motion subject to both charge and dipole moment conservation. The configuration space of this system exhibits a continuous phase transition between a weakly fragmented (\"thermalizing\") phase and a strongly fragmented (\"nonthermalizing\") phase as a function of the number density of particles. Here, by mapping to two different problems in combinatorics, we identify an exact solution for the critical density \\(n_c\\) . Specifically, when evolution proceeds by operators that act on \\(\\ell\\) contiguous sites, the critical density is given by \\(n_c = 1/(\\ell -2)\\) . We identify the critical scaling near the transition, and we show that there is a universal value of the correlation length exponent \\(\\nu = 2\\) . We confirm our theoretical results with numeric simulations. In the thermalizing phase the dynamical exponent is subdiffusive: \\(z=4\\) , while at the critical point it increases to \\(z_c \\gtrsim 6\\) . Erroneous Statistics in Physical Review Physics Education Research By Michael B. Weissman (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) Details Video recording Authors: M. B. Weissman Preprint: arXiv:2101.05647 The American Physical Society publication Physical Review Physics Education Research focuses on questions that are essentially social science. Unfortunately, it routinely publishes and promotes papers that make egregious errors in statistical reasoning, particularly in causal inference. As a result policy recommendations based on PRPER papers can rest on causal conclusions that are unsupported by evidence and sometimes (e.g. on use of GREs) flatly contradicted by the evidence. I will describe just one typical erroneous paper to illustrate the technical issues, while providing references for critiques of many others. The PRPER editorial team has an express policy of resisting the type of error correction traditionally employed by Physical Review. Josephson-Current Signatures of Unpaired Floquet Majorana Bound States By Rekha Kumari (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India) Details Video recording Authors: Rekha Kumari, Babak Seradjeh, Arijit Kundu Preprint: arXiv:2301.07707 We theoretically study the transport signatures of unpaired Floquet Majorana bound states in the Josephson current of weakly linked, periodically driven topological superconductors. We obtain the occupation of the Floquet Majorana modes in the presence of weak coupling to thermal leads analytically, and show that, similar to static superconductors, the Josephson current involving Floquet Majorana bound states is also \\(4\\pi\\) -periodic in the phase difference across the junction, and also depends linearly on the coupling between superconductors. Moreover, unlike the static case, the amplitude of the Josephson current can be tuned by setting the unbiased chemical potential of the driven superconductors at multiple harmonics of the drive frequency. As a result, we uncover a Josephson Floquet sum rule for driven superconductors. We confirm our analytical expressions for Josephson current, the occupation of Floquet bands, and a perturbative analysis of the quasienergies with numerically exact results. Interacting topological quantum chemistry of Mott atomic limits By Martina Ondina Soldini (University of Zurich) Details Video recording Authors: Martina O. Soldini, Nikita Astrakhantsev, Mikel Iraola, Apoorv Tiwari, Mark H. Fischer, Roser Valent\u00ed, Maia G. Vergniory, Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert Preprint: arXiv:2209.10556 Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) is a successful framework for identifying (non-interacting) topological materials. Based on the symmetry eigenvalues of Bloch eigenstates at high symmetry momenta, which are attainable from first principles calculations, a band structure can either be classified as an atomic limit, in other words adiabatically connected to independent electronic orbitals on the respective crystal lattice, or it is topological. For interacting systems, there is no single-particle band structure and hence, the TQC machinery grinds to a halt. We develop a framework analogous to TQC, but employing n-particle Green's function to classify interacting systems. Fundamentally, we define a class of interacting reference states that generalize the notion of atomic limits, which we call Mott atomic limits. Our formalism allows to fully classify these reference states (with n=2), which can themselves represent symmetry protected topological states. With this, we establish Mott atomic limit states as a generalisation of the atomic limits to interacting systems. Driven Andreev molecule By Andriani Keliri (LPTHE, Sorbonne University) Details Video recording Authors: Andriani Keliri, Beno\u00eet Dou\u00e7ot Preprint: arXiv:2208.11541 We study the three terminal S-QD-S-QD-S Josephson junction biased with commensurate voltages. In the absence of voltage bias, the Andreev bound states (ABS) on each quantum dot hybridize and form an Andreev molecule, producing non-local effects in the Josephson current. However, the range of the hybridization is limited by the superconducting coherence length \\(\\xi_0\\) . Application of commensurate dc voltages makes the system time-periodic, and the equilibrium ABS evolve into ladders of resonances with a finite lifetime due to multiple Andreev reflection processes. We use Floquet theory to map to a tight-binding model, and we calculate the Floquet spectrum and the subgap current. When the distance between the dots is \\(R\\sim \\xi_0,\\) we find level splitting and modification of the subgap structure due to the proximity of the two junctions. Moreover, in the regime of large dot separation \\(R\\gg \\xi_0,\\) we find that the periodic driving induces long-range coupling between the dots. Transport signatures of Van Hove singularities in mesoscopic twisted bilayer graphene By Aleksander Sanjuan Ciepielewski (MagTop, Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences) Details Video recording Authors: Aleksander Sanjuan Ciepielewski, Jakub Tworzyd\u0142o, Timo Hyart, Alexander Lau Preprint: arXiv:2208.08366 Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene exhibits quasi-flat low-energy bands with Van Hove singularities close to the Fermi level. These singularities play an important role in the exotic phenomena observed in this material, such as superconductivity and magnetism, by amplifying electronic correlation effects. In this work, we study the correspondence of four-terminal conductance and the Fermi surface topology as a function of the twist angle, pressure, and energy in mesoscopic, ballistic samples of small-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We establish a correspondence between features in the wide-junction conductance and the presence of van Hove singularities in the density of states. Moreover, we identify additional transport features, such as a large, pressure-tunable minimal conductance, conductance peaks coinciding with non-singular band crossings, and unusually large conductance oscillations as a function of the system size. Our results suggest that twisted bilayer graphene close the magic angle is a unique system featuring simultaneously large conductance due to the quasi-flat bands, strong quantum nonlinearity due to the Van Hove singularities and high sensitivity to external parameters, which could be utilized in high-frequency device applications and sensitive detectors. Measurement-induced phase transitions on dynamical quantum trees By Xiaozhou Feng (The Ohio State University) Details Video recording Authors: Xiaozhou Feng, Brian Skinner, Adam Nahum Preprint: arXiv:2210.07264 Monitored many-body systems fall broadly into two dynamical phases, \"entangling\" or \"disentangling\", separated by a transition as a function of the rate at which measurements are made on the system. Producing an analytical theory of this measurement-induced transition is an outstanding challenge. Recent work made progress in the context of tree tensor networks, which can be related to all-to-all quantum circuit dynamics with forced (postselected) measurement outcomes. So far, however, there are no exact solutions for dynamics of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom (qubits) with \"real\" measurements, whose outcome probabilities are sampled according to the Born rule. Here we define dynamical processes for qubits, with real measurements, that have a tree-like spacetime interaction graph, either collapsing or expanding the system as a function of time. The former case yields an exactly solvable measurement transition. We explore these processes analytically and numerically, exploiting the recursive structure of the tree. We compare the case of \"real\" measurements with the case of \"forced\" measurements. Both cases show a transition at a nontrivial value of the measurement strength, with the real measurement case exhibiting a smaller entangling phase. Both exhibit exponential scaling of the entanglement near the transition, but they differ in the value of a critical exponent. An intriguing difference between the two cases is that the real measurement case lies at the boundary between two distinct types of critical scaling. On the basis of our results we propose a protocol for realizing a measurement phase transition experimentally via an expansion process. Polaron spectroscopy of a bilayer excitonic insulator By Ivan Amelio (ETH Zurich) Details Video recording Authors: Ivan Amelio, Neil Drummond, Eugene Demler, Richard Schmidt, Atac Imamoglu Preprint: arXiv:2210.03658 Recent advances in fabrication of two dimensional materials and their moir\u00e9 heterostructures have opened up new avenues for realization of ground-state excitonic insulators, where the structure spontaneously develops a finite interlayer electronic polarization. We propose and analyze a scheme where an optically generated intralayer exciton is screened by excitations out of the excitonic insulator to form interlayer polarons. Using Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations we first determine the binding energy of the biexciton state composed of inter- and intralayer excitons, which plays a central role in understanding polaron formation. We describe the excitations out of the ground-state condensate using BCS theory and use a single interacting-quasiparticle-pair excitation Ansatz to describe dynamical screening of optical excitations. Our predictions carry the hallmarks of the excitonic insulator excitation spectrum and show how changing the interlayer exciton binding energy by increasing the layer separation modifies the optical spectra. Unprotected edge modes in quantum spin Hall insulator candidate materials By Wojciech Brzezicki (Jagiellonian University, Krakow) Details Authors: Nguyen Minh Nguyen, Giuseppe Cuono, Rajibul Islam, Carmine Autieri, Timo Hyart, Wojciech Brzezicki Preprint: arXiv:2209.06912 The experiments in quantum spin Hall insulator candidate materials, such as HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb heterostructures, indicate that in addition to the topologically protected helical edge modes these multilayer heterostructures may also support additional edge states, which can contribute to the scattering and the transport. We use first-principles calculations to derive an effective tight-binding model for HgTe/CdTe, HgS/CdTe and InAs/GaSb heterostructures, and we show that all these materials support additional edge states which are sensitive to the edge termination. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model supporting flat bands with a nontrivial quantum geometry that gives rise to polarization charges at the edges. We show that the polarization charges transform into the additional edge states when the flat bands are coupled to each other and to the other states to form the Hamiltonian describing the full heterostructure. Interestingly, in the HgTe/CdTe quantum wells the additional edge states are far away from the Fermi level so that they do not contribute to the transport but in the HgS/CdTe and InAs/GaSb heterostructures they appear within the bulk energy gap giving rise to the possibility of multimode edge transport. Finally, we demonstrate that because these additional edge modes are non-topological it is possible to remove them from the bulk energy gap by modifying the edge potential for example with the help of a side gate or chemical doping. Spatial separation of spin currents in transition metal dichalcogenides By Antonio Manesco (Delft University of Technology) Details Authors: Antonio L. R. Manesco, Artem Pulkin Preprint: arXiv:2206.07333 We theoretically predict spatial separation of spin-polarized ballistic currents in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to trigonal warping. We quantify the effect in terms of spin polarization of charge carrier currents in a prototypical 3-terminal ballistic device where spin-up and spin-down charge carriers exit different leads. We show that the magnitude of the current spin polarization depends strongly on the charge carrier energy and the direction with respect to crystallographic orientations in the device. We study the (negative) effect of lattice imperfections and disorder on the observed spin polarization. Our investigation provides an avenue towards observing spin discrimination in a defect-free time reversal-invariant material. Pfaffian invariant identifies magnetic obstructed atomic insulators By Isidora Araya Day (QuTech, TU Delft) Details Video recording Authors: Isidora Araya Day, Anastasiia Varentcova, Daniel Varjas, Anton R. Akhmerov Preprint: arXiv:2209.00029 We derive a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) topological invariant that extends beyond symmetry eigenvalues and Wilson loops and classifies two-dimensional insulators with a \\(C_4 \\mathcal{T}\\) symmetry. To formulate this invariant, we consider an irreducible Brillouin zone and constrain the spectrum of the open Wilson lines that compose its boundary. We fix the gauge ambiguity of the Wilson lines by using the Pfaffian at high symmetry momenta. As a result, we distinguish the four \\(C_4 \\mathcal{T}\\) -protected atomic insulators, each of which is adiabatically connected to a different atomic limit. We establish the correspondence between the invariant and the obstructed phases by constructing both the atomic limit Hamiltonians and a \\(C_4 \\mathcal{T}\\) -symmetric model that interpolates between them. The phase diagram shows that \\(C_4 \\mathcal{T}\\) insulators allow \\(\\pm 1\\) and \\(2\\) changes of the invariant, where the latter is overlooked by symmetry indicators. What is the relation between activation energy and band gap in a 2D insulator? By Yi Huang (University of Minnesota) Details Video recording Authors: Yi Huang, Brian Skinner, Boris Shklovskii Preprint: arXiv:2201.11652 What can one actually tell about the band gap from the activation energy for conductivity in a 2D material? At first glance, it seems like the activation energy should be equal to half the band gap if the Fermi level is in the middle of the gap. But this simple relation is often strongly violated in experiments, where it is common to observe a much smaller activation energy. In this talk, we will review some examples of relevant experiments in topological insulators, bilayer graphene, and Mott insulators in twisted moir\u00e9 bilayers. We will show theoretically how disorder, even when present at a very low level, almost inevitably lowers the activation energy to a nonuniversal value that is parametrically smaller than the band gap. We will further show how a sufficiently large disorder can produce an apparent insulator-to-metal transition. Greedy optimization of the geometry of Majorana Josephson junctions By Andr\u00e9 Melo (Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Andr\u00e9 Melo, Tanko Tanev, Anton R. Akhmerov Preprint: arXiv:2205.05689 Josephson junctions in a two-dimensional electron gas with spin-orbit coupling are a promising candidate to realize topological superconductivity. While it is known that the geometry of the junction strongly influences the size of the topological gap, the question of how to construct optimal geometries remains unexplored. We introduce a greedy numerical algorithm to optimize the shape of Majorana junctions. The core of the algorithm relies on perturbation theory and is embarrassingly parallel, which allows it to explore the design space efficiently. By introducing stochastic variations in the junction Hamiltonian, we avoid overfitting geometries to specific system parameters. Furthermore, we constrain the optimizer to produce smooth geometries by applying image filtering and fabrication resolution constraints. We run the algorithm in various setups and find that it reliably produces geometries with increased topological gaps over large parameter ranges. The results are robust to variations in the optimization starting point and the presence of disorder, which suggests the optimizer is capable of finding global maxima. The Josephson diode effect in supercurrent interferometers By Rub\u00e9n Seoane Souto (Center for Quantum Devices, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark Division of Solid State Physics and NanoLund, Lund University, S-22100 Lund, Sweden) Details Video recording Authors: Rub\u00e9n Seoane Souto, Martin Leijnse, and Constantin Schrade Preprint: arXiv:2205.04469 A Josephson diode is a non-reciprocal circuit element that supports a larger dissipationless super-current in one direction than in the other. In this work, we propose and theoretically study a class of Josephson diodes based on supercurrent interferometers containing mesoscopic Josephson junctions, such as point contacts or quantum dots, which are not diodes themselves but possess non-sinusoidal current-phase relations. We show that such Josephson diodes have several important advantages, like being electrically tunable and requiring neither Zeeman splitting nor spin-orbit coupling, only time-reversal breaking by a magnetic flux. We also show that our diodes have a characteristic AC response, revealed by the Shapiro steps. Even the simplest realization of our Josephson diode paradigm that relies on only two junctions can achieve efficiencies of up to \u223c 40% and far greater efficiencies are achievable by concatenating multiple interferometer loops. Theory of the supercurrent diode effect in Rashba superconductors with arbitrary disorder By Stefan Ili\u0107 (Centro de Fisica de Materiales (CFM-MPC), San Sebastian, Spain) Details Video recording Authors: Stefan Ili\u0107, Sebastian Bergeret Preprint: arXiv:2108.00209 We calculate the non-reciprocal critical current and quantify the supercurrent diode effect in Rashba superconductors with arbitrary disorder, using the quasiclassical Eilenberger equation. The non-reciprocity is caused by the helical superconducting state, which appears when both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In the absence of disorder, we find a very strong diode effect, with the non-reciprocity exceeding 40% at optimal temperatures, magnetic fields and spin-orbit coupling. We establish that the effect persists even in the presence of strong disorder. We show that the sign of the diode effect changes as magnetic field and disorder are increased, reflecting the changes in the nature of the helical state. Automated reconstruction of bound states in bilayer graphene quantum dots By Jozef Bucko (Institute for Computational Science, University of Zurich) Details Authors: Jozef Bucko, Frank Sch\u00e4fer, Franti\u0161ek Herman, Rebekka Garreis, Chuyao Tong, Annika Kurzmann, Thomas Ihn, Eliska Greplova Preprint: arXiv:2203.00697 Bilayer graphene is a nanomaterial that allows for well-defined, separated quantum states to be defined by electrostatic gating and, therefore, provides an attractive platform to construct tunable quantum dots. When a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene layers is applied, the graphene valley degeneracy is lifted, and splitting of the energy levels of the dot is observed. Given the experimental ability to engineer this energy valley splitting, bilayer graphene quantum dots have a great potential for hosting robust qubits. Although bilayer graphene quantum dots have been recently realized in experiments, it is critically important to devise robust methods that can identify the observed quantum states from accessible measurement data. Here, we develop an efficient algorithm for extracting the model parameters needed to characterize the states of a bilayer graphene quantum dot completely. We introduce a Hamiltonian-guided random search method and demonstrate robust identification of quantum states on both simulated and experimental data. Superconducting diode effect in InSb nanowires Josephson junctions By Bomin Zhang (University of Pittsburgh) Details Video recording Authors: Bomin Zhang, Zhuang Li, Victor Aguilar, Po Zhang, Mihir Pendharkar, Connor Dempsey, Joon Sue Lue, Sean Harrington, Ghada Badawy, Sasa Gazibegovic, Jason Jung, An-Hsi Chen, Susheng Tan, Marcel Verheijen, Moira Hocevar, Erik Bakkers, Chris Palmstr\u00f8m, Sergey Frolov Preprint: arXiv:Not submitted yet We study Josephson Junction in InSb nanowires with 15nm Tin shells. We observe critical current diffraction patterns skewed and inversion-symmetric in the magnetic field and bias direction. The effect is stronger when the external magnetic field is aligned perpendicular to the nanowire, in the substrate plane. i.e. in the most likely direction of the effective spin-orbit field in the junction. The effect is also tunable by the gate voltage. We discuss this effect in the context of phi0-Josephson junction physics, one consequence of which is known in recent literature as the superconducting diode effect. We consider alternative explanations such as the effective magnetic field and perform numerical simulations to understand our findings. Can Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon and Majorana vortex states be distinguished in the presence of impurities? By Bruna Mendonca (University of Sao Paulo) Details Video recording Authors: Bruna S. de Mendon\u00e7a, Antonio L. R. Manesco, Nancy Sandler, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva Preprint: arXiv:2204.05078 Majorana zero modes states (MZMs) are predicted to appear as bound states in vortices of topological superconductors. MZMs are pinned at zero energy and have zero charge due to particle-hole symmetry. MZMs in vortices of topological superconductors tend to coexist with other subgap states, named Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states. The distinction between MZMs and CdGM is limited since current experiments rely on zero-bias peak measurements obtained via scanning tunneling spectroscopy. In this work, we show that a local impurity potential can push CdGM states to zero energy. Furthermore, the finite charge in CdGM states can also drop to zero under the same mechanism. We establish, through exploration of the impurity parameter space, that these two phenomena generally happen in consonance. This means that energy and charge shifts in CdGM may be enough to imitate spectroscopic signatures of MZMs. Topological defects in a double-mirror quadrupole insulator displace diverging charge By Isidora Araya Day (QuTech and Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft) Details Video recording Authors: Isidora Araya Day, Anton R. Akhmerov, Daniel Varjas Preprint: arXiv:2202.07675 We show that topological defects in quadrupole insulators do not host quantized fractional charges, contrary to what their Wannier representation indicates. In particular, we test the charge quantization hypothesis based on the Wannier representation of a parametric defect and a disclination. Against the expectations, we find that the local charge density decays as \\(\\sim 1/r^2\\) with distance, leading to a diverging defect charge. We identify sublattice symmetry and not higher order topology as the origin of the previously reported charge quantization. Selective Control of Conductance Modes in Multi-terminal Josephson Junctions By Mohit Gupta (University of Minnesota) Details Video recording Authors: Gino V. Graziano, Mohit Gupta, Mihir Pendharkar, Jason T. Dong, Connor P. Dempsey, Chris Palmstr\u00f8m, Vlad S. Pribiag Preprint: arXiv:2201.01373 The Andreev bound state spectra of multi-terminal Josephson junctions form an artificial band structure, which is predicted to host tunable topological phases under certain conditions. However, the number of conductance modes between the terminals of multi-terminal Josephson junction must be few in order for this spectrum to be experimentally accessible. In this work we employ a quantum point contact geometry in three-terminal Josephson devices. We demonstrate independent control of conductance modes between each pair of terminals and access to the single-mode regime coexistent with the presence of superconducting coupling. These results establish a full platform on which to realize tunable Andreev bound state spectra in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. SU(2) hadrons on a quantum computer By Jinglei Zhang (Instute for Quantum Computing / University of Waterloo) Details Video recording Authors: Yasar Atas, Jinglei Zhang, Randy Lewis, Amin Jahanpour, Jan F. Haase, Christine A. Muschik Preprint: arXiv:2102.08920 We realize, for the first time, a non-Abelian gauge theory with both gauge and matter fields on a quantum computer. This enables the observation of hadrons and the calculation of their associated masses. The SU(2) gauge group considered here represents an important first step towards ultimately studying quantum chromodynamics, the theory that describes the properties of protons, neutrons and other hadrons. Quantum computers are able to create important new opportunities for ongoing essential research on gauge theories by providing simulations that are unattainable on classical computers. Our calculations on an IBM superconducting platform utilize a variational quantum eigensolver to study both meson and baryon states, hadrons which have never been seen in a non-Abelian simulation on a quantum computer. We develop a resource-efficient approach that not only allows the implementation of a full SU(2) gauge theory on present-day quantum hardware, but further lays out the premises for future quantum simulations that will address currently unanswered questions in particle and nuclear physics. Giant proximity exchange and flat Chern band in 2D magnet-semiconductor heterostructures By Nisarga Paul (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Nisarga Paul, Yang Zhang, Liang Fu Preprint: arXiv:2111.01805 Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures formed by two-dimensional magnets and semiconductors have provided a fertile ground for fundamental science and for spintronics. In this talk I discuss two main results: (1) a first-principles calculations finding a proximity exchange splitting of 14 meV equivalent to an effective Zeeman field of 120 T in the vdW magnet-semiconductor heterostructure MoS2/CrBr3 and (2) the appearance of a flat Chern band in the electronic bandstructure of 2D magnet - semiconductor heterostructures when the magnetic layer hosts chiral spin textures such as skyrmions. The latter result is derived in a completely general continuum model. More specifically, a flat Chern band is found at a \"magic\" value of magnetization (~0.2) for Schr\u00f6dinger electrons, and it generally occurs for Dirac electrons. I also discuss possible connections to skyrmions in magnetic TIs and spintronics. Longitudinal resistance oscillations in InSbAs 2DEGs in a Quantum Hall regime By Ivan Kulesh (QuTech, Delft University of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Ivan Kulesh, Mark van Blankenstein, Candice Thomas, Di Xiao, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Michael J. Manfra, Srijit Goswami Preprint: arXiv: Integer quantum Hall states interacting with a superconducting electrode, are predicted to form Andreev edge states. This effect is expected to exhibit an oscillatory interference pattern in the longitudinal resistance, measured with respect to the grounded superconducting lead. In InSb-based two-dimensional electron gases we observe pronounced longitudinal resistance oscillations. However, we verify that the origin of such oscillation is not related to the superconductivity, but rather, transport through the bulk in the disordered quantum Hall regime. Understanding the origin and location in parameter states of these oscillations is important to clearly distinguish between trivial and superconducting effects in the quantum Hall regime. Quantum anomalous Hall effect from inverted charge transfer gap: application to moire transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers By Trithep Devakul (MIT) Details Video recording Authors: Trithep Devakul, Liang Fu Preprint: arXiv:2109.13909 A general mechanism is presented by which topological physics arises in strongly correlated systems without flat bands. Starting from a charge transfer insulator, topology emerges when the charge transfer energy between the cation and anion is reduced to invert the lower Hubbard band and the spin-degenerate charge transfer band. A universal low-energy theory is developed for the inversion of charge transfer gap in an \\(xy\\) antiferromagnet. The inverted state is found to be a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator with non-coplanar magnetism. Interactions play two essential roles in this mechanism: producing the Mott gap and quasiparticle bands necessary for band inversion, and driving non-coplanar magnetism after inversion. Our theory applies to and explains the recently observed QAH state in AB-stacked TMD bilayer MoTe \\(_2\\) /WSe \\(_2\\) . Quantized Nonlinear Response in Ballistic Metals By Charles Kane (University of Pennsylvania) Details Video recording Authors: Charles Kane Preprint: arXiv:2108.05870 A dramatic consequence of the role of topology in the structure of quantum matter is the existence of topological invariants that are reflected in quantized response functions. In this talk we will discuss a new variant on this theme. We introduce a non-linear frequency dependent D+1 terminal conductance that characterizes a D dimensional Fermi gas, generalizing the Landauer conductance in 1 dimension. For a 2D ballistic conductor we show that this conductance is quantized and probes the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea. We critically address the roles of electrical contacts and of Fermi liquid interactions, and we propose experiments on 2D Dirac materials such as graphene using a triple point contact geometry. Ising superconductivity in few-layer stanene By Ding Zhang (Tsinghua University) Details Video recording Authors: Joseph Falson, Yong Xu, Menghan Liao, Yunyi Zang, Kejing Zhu, Chong Wang, Zetao Zhang, Hongchao Liu, Wenhui Duan, Ke He, Haiwen Liu, Jurgen H. Smet, Ding Zhang, Qi-Kun Xue Preprint: arXiv:1903.07627 The two-dimensional crystalline superconductors possess a variety of exotic properties. For instance, their Cooper pairs can sustain a large in-plane magnetic field owning to the spin-orbital locking [1]. Here we report two-dimensional superconductivity in few layer stanene\u2014ultrathin gray tin (111)\u2014with an enhanced in-plane upper critical field. The emergence of superconductivity in stanene is unexpected because bulk gray tin is non-superconductive. We found superconductivity in few-layer stanene on PbTe/Bi2Te3/Si(111) substrate grown by molecular beam epitaxy [2]. The superconducting properties can be modulated by varying the substrate thickness. The band structure of this system is consistent with first-principles calculations, suggesting topologically non-trivial properties. Furthermore, few-layer stanene hosts enhanced in-plane upper critical fields that greatly exceed the conventional limit. Few-layer stanene is centrosymmetric and its electronic bands center around the \u0393 point. Therefore, the established Ising superconductivity for transition metal dichalcogenide does not apply. Instead, we propose a novel type of spin locking mechanism\u2014dubbed type-II Ising pairing, which accounts for the large in-plane upper critical magnetic field in centrosymmetric superconductor with multiple degenerate orbitals [3].

Mechanisms of Andreev reflection in quantum Hall graphene By Antonio Manesco (TU Delft) Details Video recording Authors: Antonio L. R. Manesco, Ian Matthias Fl\u00f3r, Chun-Xiao Liu, Anton R. Akhmerov Preprint: arXiv:2103.06722 We simulate a hybrid superconductor-graphene device in the quantum Hall regime to identify the origin of downstream resistance oscillations in a recent experiment [Zhao et. al. Nature Physics 16, (2020)]. In addition to the previously studied Mach-Zehnder interference between the valley-polarized edge states, we consider disorder-induced scattering, and the previously overlooked appearance of the counter-propagating states generated by the interface density mismatch. Comparing our results with the experiment, we conclude that the observed oscillations are induced by the interfacial disorder, and that lattice-matched superconductors are necessary to observe the alternative ballistic effects. Topologically Localized Insulators By Bastien Lapierre (University of Zurich) Details Video recording Authors: Bastien Lapierre, Titus Neupert, Luka Trifunovic Preprint: arXiv:2110.14651 In this talk I will show that fully localized, three-dimensional, time-reversal-symmetry-broken Anderson insulators support topologically distinct phases that can be labelled by integers. Any two such topologically localized phases are separated by a metallic phase. These novel topological phases are fundamentally distinct from insulators without disorder: they are guaranteed to host delocalized states along their insulating boundaries, giving rise to the quantized boundary Hall conductance whose value is determined by the integer invariant assigned to the bulk. SciPost and the reform of scientific publishing By Jean-S\u00e9bastien Caux (University of Amsterdam) Details Video recording Authors: Jean-S\u00e9bastien Caux Preprint: arXiv: SciPost is a not-for-profit publishing initiative conceived, implemented and run by professional scientists. Leveraging the idea of openness, it aims to increase the utility and meaningfulness of the peer refereeing process. Committed to scientific quality, it aims to offer high-quality publishing venues, thereby bringing control of publishing into the hands of active academics. SciPost also implements a cost-slashing, institutions-backed consortial business model deprecating subscription fees or article processing charges, and aiming to shield scientists from the pernicious influence of profit-making in the publishing industry. This talk will summarize operations since the launch of the portal in 2016, share experiences gained, and provide perspectives for future developments in the reform of scientific publishing. Dirac Magic and Lifshitz Transitions in AA-Stacked Twisted Multilayer Graphene By Yantao Li (Indiana University) Details Video recording Authors: Yantao Li, Adam Eaton, H. A. Fertig, Babak Seradjeh Preprint: arXiv:2107.10687 We uncover a new type of magic-angle phenomena when an AA-stacked graphene bilayer is twisted relative to another graphene system with band touching. In the simplest case this constitutes a trilayer system formed by an AA-stacked bilayer twisted relative to a single layer of graphene. We find multiple anisotropic Dirac cones coexisting in such twisted multilayer structures at certain angles, which we call \"Dirac magic.\" We trace the origin of Dirac magic angles to the geometric structure of the twisted AA-bilayer Dirac cones relative to the other band-touching spectrum in the moir\\'e reciprocal lattice. The anisotropy of the Dirac cones and a concomitant cascade of saddle points induce a series of topological Lifshitz transitions that can be tuned by the twist angle and perpendicular electric field. We discuss the possibility of direct observation of Dirac magic as well as its consequences for the correlated states of electrons in this moir\\'e system. Mysteries near the zero-field Wigner crystal transition in a 2D electron system By Brian Skinner (Ohio State University) Details Video recording Authors: Joseph Falson, Inti Sodemann, Brian Skinner, Daniela Tabrea, Yusuke Kozuka, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Masashi Kawasaki, Klaus von Klitzing, Jurgen H Smet Preprint: arXiv:2103.16586 I will discuss recent experimental results on the low-temperature transport in a strongly interacting zinc-oxide-based high mobility two dimensional electron system. The data shows clear hallmarks of the long-anticipated transition between a Fermi liquid phase and a Wigner crystal phase at zero magnetic field. Other features of the data, however, suggest new mysteries in the vicinity of this transition. This talk will highlight those mysteries, and overview a number of sharp and unexpected questions that are implied by the data. I will focus on the resistivity at ultra-low temperatures as a function of electron concentration and spin polarization. Spin-textured Chern bands in AB-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer MoTe2/WSe2 By Yang Zhang (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Yang Zhang, Trithep Devakul, Liang Fu Preprint: arXiv:2107.02167 While transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) based moire materials have been shown to host various correlated electronic phenomena, topological states have not been experimentally observed until now. In this work, using first principles calculations and continuum modeling, we reveal the displacement field induced topological moire bands in AB-stacked TMD heterobilayer MoTe2/WSe2. Valley contrasting Chern bands with non-trivial spin texture are formed from interlayer hybridization between MoTe2 and WSe2 bands of nominally opposite spins. Our study establishes a recipe for creating topological bands in AB stacked TMD bilayers in general, which provides a highly tunable platform for realizing quantum spin Hall and interaction induced quantum anomalous Hall effects. Cavity magnon-polaritons in cuprate parent compounds By Jonathan Curtis (Harvard University) Details Video recording Authors: Jonathan B. Curtis, Andrey Grankin, Nicholas R. Poniatowski, Victor M. Galitski, Prineha Narang, Eugene Demler Preprint: arXiv:2106.07828 Cavity control of quantum matter may offer new ways to study and manipulate many-body systems. A particularly appealing idea is to use cavities to enhance superconductivity, especially in unconventional or high- \\(T_c\\) systems. Motivated by this, we propose a scheme for coupling Terahertz resonators to the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in a cuprate parent compound, which are believed to provide the glue for Cooper pairs in the superconducting phase. First, we derive the interaction between magnon excitations of the Ne\\'el-order and polar phonons associated with the planar oxygens. This mode also couples to the cavity electric field, and in the presence of spin-orbit interactions mediates a linear coupling between the cavity and magnons, forming hybridized magnon-polaritons. This hybridization vanishes linearly with photon momentum, implying the need for near-field optical methods, which we analyze within a simple model. We then derive a higher-order coupling between the cavity and magnons which is only present in bilayer systems, but does not rely on spin-orbit coupling. This interaction is found to be large, but only couples to the bimagnon operator. As a result we find a strong, but heavily damped, bimagnon-cavity interaction which produces highly asymmetric cavity line-shapes in the strong-coupling regime. To conclude, we outline several interesting extensions of our theory, including applications to carrier-doped cuprates and other strongly-correlated systems with Terahertz-scale magnetic excitations. Supercurrent diode effect and finite momentum superconductivity By Noah F. Q. Yuan (Shenzhen JL Computational Science and Applied Research Institute) Details Video recording Authors: Noah F. Q. Yuan, Liang Fu Preprint: arXiv:2106.01909 When both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, the critical current of a superconductor can be nonreciprocal. In this work we show that in certain classes of two-dimensional superconductors with antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, Cooper pairs acquire a finite momentum upon the application of an in-plane magnetic field, and as a result, critical currents in the direction parallel and antiparallel to the Cooper pair momentum become unequal. This supercurrent diode effect is also manifested in the polarity-dependence of in-plane critical fields induced by a supercurrent. These nonreciprocal effects may be found in polar SrTiO \\(_3\\) film, few-layer MoTe \\(_2\\) in the \\(T_d\\) phase, and twisted bilayer graphene in which the valley degrees of freedom plays the role analogous to spin. Superconductivity provides a giant enhancement to the spin battery effect By Risto Ojaj\u00e4rvi (University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4) Details Video recording Authors: Risto Ojaj\u00e4rvi, Tero T. Heikkil\u00e4, P. Virtanen, M. A. Silaev Preprint: arXiv:2103.07412 We develop a theory of the spin battery effect in superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (SC/FI) systems taking into account the magnetic proximity effect. We demonstrate that the spin-energy mixing enabled by the superconductivity leads to the enhancement of spin accumulation by several orders of magnitude relative to the normal state. This finding can explain the recently observed giant inverse spin Hall effect generated by thermal magnons in the SC/FI system. We suggest a non-local electrical detection scheme which can directly probe the spin accumulation driven by the magnetization dynamics. We predict a giant Seebeck effect converting the magnon temperature bias into the non-local voltage signal. We also show how this can be used to enhance the sensitivity of magnon detection even up to the single-magnon level. Correlations and computational quantum transport: an approach for the automatic calculation of Feynman diagrams at large orders By Xavier Waintal (PHELIQS, CEA Grenoble, France) Details Video recording Authors: Marjan Ma\u010dek, Philipp T. Dumitrescu, Corentin Bertrand, Bill Triggs, Olivier Parcollet, Xavier Waintal Preprint: arXiv:2002.12372 Even in the simplest quantum nanoelectronic devices, such as quantum dots (Kondo effect, Coulomb blockade) or quantum point contacts (0.7 anomaly), electronic correlations play a central role. Yet, except in some specific situations, these correlations are beyond the reach of existing numerical techniques. In this talk, I will present our efforts to build algorithms that systematically and automatically calculate all Feynman diagrams up to very large order (10-22). As a first real life application, I will show how the technique can be used to solve the Kondo problem out-of-equilibrium. Correlation-induced valley topology in buckled graphene superlattices By Antonio Manesco (University of S\u00e3o Paulo) Details Video recording Authors: Antonio L. R. Manesco, Jose L. Lado Preprint: arXiv:2104.00573 Flat bands emerging in buckled monolayer graphene superlattices have been recently shown to realize correlated states analogous to those observed in twisted graphene multilayers. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of valley topology driven by competing electronic correlations in buckled graphene superlattices. We show, both by means of atomistic models and a low-energy description, that the existence of long-range electronic correlations leads to a competition between antiferromagnetic and charge density wave instabilities, that can be controlled by means of screening engineering. Interestingly, we find that the emergent charge density wave has a topologically non-trivial electronic structure, leading to a coexistent quantum valley Hall insulating state. In a similar fashion, the antiferromagnetic phase realizes a spin-polarized quantum valley-Hall insulating state. Our results put forward buckled graphene superlattices as a new platform to realize interaction-induced topological matter. Multiplet supercurrent in Josephson tunneling circuits By Andr\u00e9 Melo (Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Andr\u00e9 Melo, Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov Preprint: arXiv:2104.11239 The multi-terminal Josephson effect allows DC supercurrent to flow at finite commensurate voltages. Existing proposals to realize this effect rely on nonlocal Andreev processes in superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions. However, this approach requires precise control over microscopic states and is obscured by dissipative current. We show that standard tunnel Josephson circuits also support multiplet supercurrent mediated only by local tunneling processes. Furtheremore, we observe that the supercurrents persist even in the high charging energy regime in which only sequential Cooper transfers are allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that the multiplet supercurrent in these circuits has a quantum geometric component that is distinguinshable from the well-known adiabatic contribution. Realization of the field-free Josephson diode By Mazhar Ali (Max Planck Institute for Microstructure Physics) Details Video recording Authors: Heng Wu, Yaojia Wang, Pranava K. Sivakumar, Chris Pasco, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Yu-Jia Zeng, Tyrel McQueen, Mazhar N. Ali Preprint: arXiv:2103.15809 The superconducting analog to the semiconducting diode, the Josephson diode, has long been sought, with multiple avenues to realization proposed by theorists. Exhibiting magnetic-field free, single directional superconductivity with Josephson coupling of the supercurrent across a tunnel barrier, it would serve as the building-block for next-generation superconducting circuit technology. Here we realized the field-free Josephson diode using an inversion symmetry breaking heterostructure of \\(\\mathrm{NbSe_2/Nb_3Br_8/NbSe_2}\\) . We demonstrate, for the first time without magnetic field, the junction can be superconducting in one direction while normal in the opposite direction. Based on that, half-wave rectification of a square-wave excitation was achieved with low switching current density ( \\(~2.2\\times 10^2 \\mathrm{A/cm^2}\\) ), high rectification ratio ( \\(~10^4\\) ) and high robustness (at least \\(10^4\\) cycles). We also demonstrate symmetric \\(\\Delta I_\\mathrm{c}\\) (the difference between positive and negative critical currents) behavior with field and the expected Fraunhofer current phase relation of a Josephson junction. This realization raises fundamental questions about the Josephson effect through an insulator when breaking symmetry, and opens the door to ultralow power, high speed, superconducting circuits for logic and signal modulation. Quantum many-body topology of quasicrystals By Dominic Else (MIT) Details Video recording Authors: Dominic V. Else, Sheng-Jie Huang, Abhinav Prem, Andrey Gromov Preprint: arXiv:2103.13393 In this paper, we characterize quasicrystalline interacting topological phases of matter i.e., phases protected by some quasicrystalline structure. We show that the elasticity theory of quasicrystals, which accounts for both \"phonon\" and \"phason\" modes, admits non-trivial quantized topological terms with far richer structure than their crystalline counterparts. We show that these terms correspond to distinct phases of matter and also uncover intrinsically quasicrystalline phases, which have no crystalline analogues. For quasicrystals with internal \\(\\mathrm{U}(1)\\) symmetry, we discuss a number of interpretations and physical implications of the topological terms, including constraints on the mobility of dislocations in \\(d=2\\) quasicrystals and a quasicrystalline generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Oshikawa-Hastings theorem. We then extend these ideas much further and address the complete classification of quasicrystalline topological phases, including systems with point-group symmetry as well as non-invertible phases. We hence obtain the \"Quasicrystalline Equivalence Principle,\" which generalizes the classification of crystalline topological phases to the quasicrystalline setting. Superconductivity mediated by a third-electron: Spin-triplet superconductivity from excitonic e\ufb00ect in doped band insulators By Valentin Cr\u00e9pel (MIT) Details Video recording Authors: Valentin Cr\u00e9pel and Liang Fu Preprint: arXiv:arXiv:2012.08528 and arXiv:2103.12060 In this talk, I will comprehensively review the general electronic mechanism for superconductivity introduced in arXiv:2012.08528 and arXiv:2103.12060. There, it is shown that a non-retarded pairing interaction can be produced from the electron-electron repulsion itself through virtual inter-band transitions. The theory presented is analytically controlled by a strong-coupling expansion in the kinetic energy term and explicitly demonstrated in doped band insulators with the example of an extended Hubbard model. This work demonstrates a powerful method for studying strong coupling superconductivity. It also offers realistic new routes to realize unconventional superconducting state with, for instance, finite angular momentum or spin-triplet pairing. Flat band induced non-Fermi liquid behavior of multicomponent fermions By Pramod Kumar (Aalto University) Details Video recording Authors: Pramod Kumar, Sebastiano Peotta, Yosuke Takasu, Yoshiro Takahashi, P\u00e4ivi T\u00f6rm\u00e4 Preprint: arXiv:2005.05457 We investigate multicomponent fermions in a flat band and predict experimental signatures of non-Fermi liquid behavior. We use dynamical mean-field theory to obtain the density, double occupancy and entropy in a Lieb lattice for \\(\\mathcal{N} = 2\\) and \\(\\mathcal{N} = 4\\) components. We derive a mean-field scaling relation between the results for different values of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) , and study its breakdown due to beyond-mean field effects. The predicted signatures occur at temperatures above the N\\'eel temperature and persist in presence of a harmonic trapping potential, thus they are observable with current ultracold gas experiments. Deconfinement of Majorana vortex modes produces a superconducting Landau level By Micha\u0142 Pacholski (Instituut-Lorentz, Universiteit Leiden) Details Video recording Authors: M. J. Pacholski, G. Lemut, O. Ovdat, \u0130. Adagideli, C. W. J. Beenakker Preprint: arXiv:2101.08252 A spatially oscillating pair potential \\(\\Delta(r)=\\Delta_0 e^{i K\\cdot x}\\) with momentum \\(K>\\Delta_0/\\hbar v\\) drives a deconfinement transition of the Majorana bound states in the vortex cores of a Fu-Kane heterostructure (a 3D topological insulator with Fermi velocity \\(v\\) , on a superconducting substrate with gap \\(\\Delta_0\\) , in a perpendicular magnetic field). In the deconfined phase at zero chemical potential the Majorana fermions form a dispersionless Landau level, protected by chiral symmetry against broadening due to vortex scattering. The coherent superposition of electrons and holes in the Majorana Landau level is detectable as a local density of states oscillation with wave vector \\(\\sqrt{K^2-(\\Delta_0/\\hbar v)^2}\\) . The striped pattern also provides a means to measure the chirality of the Majorana fermions. Numerical evidence for marginal scaling at the integer quantum Hall transition By Elizabeth Dresselhaus (University of California, Berkeley) Details Video recording Authors: E. J. Dresselhaus, B. Sbierski, I. A. Gruzberg Preprint: arXiv:2101.01716 The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling flow close to the critical fixed point in the parameter plane spanned by the longitudinal and Hall conductivities has been studied vigorously both by experiments and with numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M. Zirnbauer [Nucl. Phys. B 941, 458 (2019)] has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition, in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality, we confirm the marginal scaling of the longitudinal conductivity towards the conjectured fixed-point value \\(\\sigma_{xx} = 2/\\pi\\) . Away from criticality we describe a mechanism that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents \\(\\nu_{eff}\\) , which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We confirm this idea by exact numerical determination of \\(\\nu_{eff}\\) in suitably chosen models. Amorphous topological phases protected by continuous rotation symmetry By Helene Spring (TU Delft) Details Video recording Authors: Helene Spring, Anton R. Akhmerov, Daniel Varjas Preprint: arXiv:2012.12909 Protection of topological surface states by reflection symmetry breaks down when the boundary of the sample is misaligned with one of the high symmetry planes of the crystal. We demonstrate that this limitation is removed in amorphous topological materials, where the Hamiltonian is invariant on average under reflection over any axis due to continuous rotation symmetry. While the local disorder caused by the amorphous structure weakens the topological protection, we demonstrate that the edge remains protected from localization. In order to classify such phases we perform a systematic search over all the possible symmetry classes in two dimensions and construct the example models realizing each of the proposed topological phases. Finally, we compute the topological invariant of these phases as an integral along a meridian of the spherical Brillouin zone of an amorphous Hamiltonian. Bloch-Lorentz magnetoresistance oscillations in delafossites By Kostas Vilkelis (Qutech, Delft University of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Kostas Vilkelis, Lin Wang, Anton Akhmerov Preprint: arXiv:2012.08552 Recent measurements of the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of delafossites (PdCoO \\(_2\\) and PtCoO \\(_2\\) ) observed oscillations which closely resemble the Aharanov-Bohm effect. We develop a semiclassical theory of these oscillations and show that they are a consequence of the quasi-2D dispersion of delafossites. We observe that the Lorentz force created by an in-plane magnetic field makes the out-of-plane motion of electrons oscillatory, similarly to Bloch oscillations. Analysis of the visibility of these Bloch-Lorentz oscillations reveals the mean-free path to be \\(l \\approx 4.4 \\mu m\\) in comparison to the literature in-plane mean free path of \\(20 \\mu m\\) . The mean-free path is reduced as a consequence of the out-of-plane relaxation and sample wall scattering. Our theory offers a way to design an experimental geometry that is better suited for probing the phenomenon and to investigate the out-of-plane dynamics of ballistic quasi-two-dimensional materials. Floquet Gauge Pump By Abhishek Kumar (Indiana University Bloomington) Details Video recording Authors: Abhishek Kumar, Gerardo Ortiz, Philip Richerme, Babak Seradjeh Preprint: arXiv:2012.09677 We introduce the concept of a Floquet gauge pump whereby a dynamically engineered Floquet Hamiltonian is employed to reveal the inherent degeneracy of the ground state in interacting systems. We demonstrate this concept in a one-dimensional XY model with periodically driven couplings and transverse field. In the high frequency limit, we obtain the Floquet Hamiltonian consisting of the static XY and dynamically generated Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) terms. The dynamically generated magnetization current depends on the phases of complex coupling terms, with the XY interaction as the real and DMI as the imaginary part. As these phases are cycled, it reveals the ground state degeneracies that distinguish the ordered and disordered phases. We discuss experimental requirements needed to realize the Floquet gauge pump in a synthetic quantum spin system of interacting trapped ions. Electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al hybrid nanowires By Chun-Xiao Liu (Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands) Details Video recording Authors: Chun-Xiao Liu, Sergej Schuwalow, Yu Liu, Kostas Vilkelis, A. L. R. Manesco, P. Krogstrup, Michael Wimmer Preprint: arXiv:2011.06567 We study the electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al heterostructures as explored in a recent experiment [S. Vaitiekenas \\emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2020)], combining both spectroscopic results and microscopic device simulations. In particular, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band bending at the InAs/EuS interface. The resulting band offset value serves as an essential input to subsequent microscopic device simulations, allowing us to map the electronic wave function distribution. We conclude that the magnetic proximity effects at the Al/EuS as well as the InAs/EuS interfaces are both essential to achieve topological superconductivity at zero applied magnetic field. Mapping the topological phase diagram as a function of gate voltages and proximity-induced exchange couplings, we show that the ferromagnetic hybrid nanowire with overlapping Al and EuS layers can become a topological superconductor within realistic parameter regimes. Our work highlights the need for a combined experimental and theoretical effort for faithful device simulation. Strain-engineering the topological type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2 By Antonio Manesco (University of S\u00e3o Paulo) Details Video recording Authors: Pedro P. Ferreira, Antonio L. R. Manesco, Thiago T. Dorini, Lucas E. Correa, Gabrielle Weber, Antonio J. S. Machado, Luiz T. F. Eleno Preprint: arXiv:2006.14071 In this work, the electronic and elastic properties of the type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe \\(_2\\) , in equilibrium and under strain, were systematically studied within the scope of density functional theory (DFT) and effective models. We have demonstrated that strain-engineering is an effective route for manipulating its electronic and topological properties. We have shown that compressive and tensile deformations control the Dirac node momentum and their energy relative to the Fermi level. Moreover, it is possible to lower or increase the overlap between the low-energy wave functions and suppress trivial bands, opening the way for superconductivity, Liftshtz transitions, and a hybrid type-I and type-II Dirac semimetallic phase. Furthermore, we provided a minimal effective model for the Dirac cone and derive the mentioned strain effects using lattice regularization, providing an inexpensive way for further theoretical investigations and easy comparison with experiments. We also proposed statically controlling the electronic-structure with the intercalation of alkali-element species into the van der Waals gap, resulting in a similar physical response to the one obtained by strain-engineering. Many-body Majorana-like zero modes without gauge symmetry breaking By Vasilii Vadimov (QCD Labs, Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University) Details Video recording Authors: V. Vadimov, T. Hyart, J. L. Lado, M. M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen, T. Ala-Nissila Preprint: arXiv:2011.06552 Topological superconductors represent one of the key hosts of Majorana-based topological quantum computing. Typical scenarios for one-dimensional topological superconductivity assume a broken gauge symmetry associated to a superconducting state. However, no interacting one-dimensional many-body system is known to spontaneously break gauge symmetries. Here, we show that zero modes emerge in a many-body system without gauge symmetry breaking and in the absence of superconducting order. In particular, we demonstrate that Majorana zero modes of the symmetry-broken superconducting state are continuously connected to these zero-mode excitations, demonstrating that zero-bias anomalies may emerge in the absence of gauge symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that these many-body zero modes share the robustness features of the Majorana zero modes of symmetry-broken topological superconductors. We introduce a bosonization formalism to analyze these excitations and show that a ground state analogous to a topological superconducting state can be analytically found in a certain limit. Our results demonstrate that robust Majorana-like zero modes may appear in a many-body systems without gauge symmetry breaking, thus introducing a family of protected excitations with no single-particle analogs. Statistical Floquet prethermalization from kicked rotors to the Bose-Hubbard model By Dalla Torre Emanuele (Bar-Ilan University) Details Video recording Authors: Emanuele G. Dalla Torre Preprint: arXiv:2005.07207 The manipulation of many-body systems often involves time-dependent forces that cause unwanted heating. One strategy to suppress heating is to use time-periodic (Floquet) forces at large frequencies. In particular, for quantum spin systems with bounded spectra, it was shown rigorously that the heating rate is exponentially small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential suppression of heating has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold atoms, realizing a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an unbounded spectrum and, hence, is beyond the reach of previous theoretical approaches. Here, we develop a semiclassical description of Floquet prethermal states and link the suppressed heating rate to the low probability of finding many particles on a single site. We derive an analytic expression for the exponential suppression of heating valid at strong interactions and large temperatures, which matches the exact numerical solution of the model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance of statistical arguments to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body quantum systems. Topological phonons in oxide perovskites controlled by light By Bo Peng (Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge) Details Video recording Authors: Bo Peng, Yuchen Hu, Shuichi Murakami, Tiantian Zhang, Bartomeu Monserrat Preprint: arXiv:10.17863/CAM.57482 Perovskite oxides exhibit a rich variety of structural phases hosting different physical phenomena that generate multiple technological applications. We find that topological phonons \u2013 nodal rings, nodal lines, and Weyl points \u2013 are ubiquitous in oxide perovskites in terms of structures (tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3), and external conditions (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular, in the tetragonal phase of these compounds all types of topological phonons can simultaneously emerge when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the tetragonal phase stabilized by thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited set of topological phonon states. In addition, we find that the photoexcited carrier concentration can be used to tune the topological phonon states and induce topological transitions even without associated structural phase changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as a versatile platform in which to study topological phonons and their manipulation with light. Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene superlattices By Julien Barrier (The University of Manchester, U.K.) Details Video recording Authors: Julien Barrier, Piranavan Kumaravadivel, Roshan Krishna-Kumar, L. A. Ponomarenko, Na Xin, Matthew Holwill, Ciaran Mullan, Minsoo Kim, R. V. Gorbachev, M. D. Thompson, J. R. Prance, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, I. V. Grigorieva, K. S. Novoselov, A. Mishchenko, V. I. Fal'ko, A. K. Geim, A. I. Berdyugin Preprint: arXiv:2006.15040 In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can be viewed as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands recurring at rational ( \\(p/q\\) ) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak fermions can exhibit mobilities above 10 \\(^6\\) cm \\(^2\\) V \\(^{-1}\\) s \\(^{-1}\\) and the mean free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are \\(4q\\) times degenerate and all the degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at \\(1/q\\) fractions for electrical probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field. Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite bias By Andr\u00e9 Melo (Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology) Details Video recording Authors: Andr\u00e9 Melo, Chun-Xiao Liu, Piotr Ro\u017cek, T\u00f3mas \u00d6rn Rosdahl, Michael Wimmer Preprint: arXiv:2008.01734 Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work, we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source of conductance asymmetries. Topological Band Structures in the Offset-Parameter-Dependence of Small Josephson Circuits By Valla Fatemi (Yale University) Details Video recording Authors: Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov, Landry Bretheau Preprint: arXiv:2008.13758 We introduce Weyl Josephson circuits: small Josephson junction circuits that simulate Weyl band structures. We first formulate a general approach to design circuits that are analogous to Bloch Hamiltonians of a desired dimensionality and symmetry class. We then construct and analyze a six-junction device that produces a 3D Weyl Hamiltonian with broken inversion symmetry and in which topological phase transitions can be triggered in situ . We argue that currently available superconducting circuit technology allows experiments that probe topological properties inaccessible in condensed matter systems. Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids By Joshuah T. Heath (Boston College) Details Video recording Authors: Joshuah T. Heath Preprint: arXiv:2001.08230 The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing By Hamed Vakili (Dept. of Physics University of Virginia) Details Video recording Authors: Hamed Vakili, Mohammad Nazmus Sakib, Samiran Ganguly, Mircea Stan, Matthew W. Daniels, Advait Madhavan, Mark D. Stiles, Avik W. Ghosh Preprint: arXiv:2005.10704 Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping. Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can be used for solving large graph theoretical problems. Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene By Antonio Manesco (University of S\u00e3o Paulo) Details Video recording Authors: Antonio L. R. Manesco, Jose L. Lado, Eduardo V. S. Ribeiro, Gabrielle Weber, Durval Rodrigues Jr Preprint: arXiv:2003.05163 Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe \\(_2\\) substrates, wrinkled graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover, we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.","title":"Speakers' Corner"},{"location":"survey-2022/","text":"Online scientific event survey After almost two years of running online events, we would like to investigate how to move forward: what do our colleagues value?

Unconventional superconductors are a consequence of breaking of other symmetries. Thus, additional degrees of freedom (orbital, sublattice, bands, valley, etc.), electronic correlations, or more chemical elements reduce the symmetries leading to unconventional superconducting states. One might also obtain unconventional and exotic states extrinsically, e.g. by changing the geometry (interfaces and heterostructures) and applying gates or magnetic fields. This two-day workshop will gather experimentalists and theorists to discuss recent developments in unconventional and exotic superconductivity. The workshop's themes span heavy-fermion systems, high-Tc materials, high magnetic field effects, flat-band systems, and non-equilibrium superconductivity.
