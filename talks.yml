  title: Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to finite
    bias
  abstract: 'Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions
    is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting
    devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap
    conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and
    unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits
    deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work,
    we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle
    poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include
    the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant
    conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify
    the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible
    mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental
    to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that
    can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source
    of conductance asymmetries.'

  title: Landau Quasiparticles in Weak Power-Law Liquids
  abstract: The failure of Landau-Fermi liquid theory is often considered a telltale
    sign of universal, scale-invariant behavior in the emergent field theory of interacting
    fermions. Nevertheless, there exist borderline cases where weak scale invariance
    coupled with particle-hole asymmetry can coexist with the Landau quasiparticle
    paradigm. In this letter, I show explicitly that a Landau-Fermi liquid can exist
    for weak power-law scaling of the retarded Green's function. Such an exotic variant
    of the traditional Fermi liquid, although exhibiting a finite quasiparticle weight
    and large quasiparticle lifetime, is shown to always be incompatible with Luttinger's
    theorem for any non-trivial scaling. This result yields evidence for a Fermi liquid-like
    ground state in the high-field, underdoped pseudogap phase of the high-temperature
    cuprate superconductors.

  title: Using skyrmionic racetracks for unconventional computing
  abstract: Skyrmions are topological excitations in thin magnetic films with broken
    spatial symmetry, and can be driven at high speeds along magnetic racetracks using
    modest currents in heavy metal underlayers. However, they suffer strong Magnus
    forces arising from their vorticity. Eliminating these Magnus forces requires
    precise tuning of parameters that are hard to execute during fabrication. We show
    how Heusler ferrimagnetic racetracks can achieve high speeds and low damping.
    Instead of eliminating Magnus forces, we show how designing a spatially varying
    magnetic parameter, such as a graded PtxW1-x alloy, creates a moving skyrmion
    that keeps evolving into a growing hybrid between Bloch and Neel until it reaches
    an automatic compensation line where it self-converges into a racetrack. We can
    further tune the compensation line using a combination of static and gate-controlled
    dynamic magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we describe how the position of skyrmions
    along racetracks can be used as a native memory for temporal race logic that can
    be used for solving large graph theoretical problems.

  title: Correlations in the elastic Landau level of spontaneously buckled graphene
  abstract: Electronic correlations stemming from nearly flat bands in van der Waals
    materials have demonstrated to be a powerful playground to engineer artificial
    quantum matter, including superconductors, correlated insulators and topological
    matter. This phenomenology has been experimentally observed in a variety of twisted
    van der Waals materials, such as graphene and dichalcogenide multilayers. Here
    we show that spontaneously buckled graphene can yield a correlated state, emerging
    from an elastic pseudo Landau level. Our results build on top of recent experimental
    findings reporting that, when placed on top of hBN or NbSe$_2$ substrates, wrinkled
    graphene sheets relax forming a periodic, long-range buckling pattern. The low-energy
    physics can be accurately described by electrons in the presence of a pseudo-axial
    gauge field, leading to the formation of sublattice-polarized Landau levels. Moreover,
    we verify that the high density of states at the zeroth Landau level leads to
    the formation of a periodically modulated ferrimagnetic groundstate, which can
    be controlled by the application of external electric fields. Our results indicate
    that periodically strained graphene is a versatile platform to explore emergent
    electronic states arising from correlated elastic Landau levels.

  title: Long-range ballistic transport of Brown-Zak fermions in graphene superlattices
  abstract: In quantizing magnetic fields, graphene superlattices exhibit a complex
    fractal spectrum often referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. It can be viewed
    as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands
    recurring at rational ($p/q$) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice
    unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak
    fermions can exhibit mobilities above 10$^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and the mean
    free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices
    allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are $4q$ times degenerate and all the
    degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions
    below 1K. We also found negative bend resistance at $1/q$ fractions for electrical
    probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights
    the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high
    fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field.

  title: Statistical Floquet prethermalization from kicked rotors to the Bose-Hubbard
    model
  abstract: The manipulation of many-body systems often involves time-dependent forces
    that cause unwanted heating. One strategy to suppress heating is to use time-periodic
    (Floquet) forces at large frequencies. In particular, for quantum spin systems
    with bounded spectra, it was shown rigorously that the heating rate is exponentially
    small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential suppression of heating
    has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold atoms, realizing a periodically
    driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an unbounded spectrum and, hence, is
    beyond the reach of previous theoretical approaches. Here, we develop a semiclassical
    description of Floquet prethermal states and link the suppressed heating rate
    to the low probability of finding many particles on a single site. We derive an
    analytic expression for the exponential suppression of heating valid at strong
    interactions and large temperatures, which matches the exact numerical solution
    of the model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance of statistical arguments
    to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body quantum systems.

  title: Many-body Majorana-like zero modes without gauge symmetry breaking
  abstract: Topological superconductors represent one of the key hosts of Majorana-based
    topological quantum computing. Typical scenarios for one-dimensional topological
    superconductivity assume a broken gauge symmetry associated to a superconducting
    state. However, no interacting one-dimensional many-body system is known to spontaneously
    break gauge symmetries. Here, we show that zero modes emerge in a many-body system
    without gauge symmetry breaking and in the absence of superconducting order. In
    particular, we demonstrate that Majorana zero modes of the symmetry-broken superconducting
    state are continuously connected to these zero-mode excitations, demonstrating
    that zero-bias anomalies may emerge in the absence of gauge symmetry breaking.
    We demonstrate that these many-body zero modes share the robustness features of
    the Majorana zero modes of symmetry-broken topological superconductors. We introduce
    a bosonization formalism to analyze these excitations and show that a ground state
    analogous to a topological superconducting state can be analytically found in
    a certain limit. Our results demonstrate that robust Majorana-like zero modes
    may appear in a many-body systems without gauge symmetry breaking, thus introducing
    a family of protected excitations with no single-particle analogs.

  title: Electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al hybrid nanowires
  abstract: We study the electronic properties of InAs/EuS/Al heterostructures as
    explored in a recent experiment [S. Vaitiekenas \emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2020)],
    combining both spectroscopic results and microscopic device simulations. In particular,
    we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band bending
    at the InAs/EuS interface. The resulting band offset value serves as an essential
    input to subsequent microscopic device simulations, allowing us to map the electronic
    wave function distribution. We conclude that the magnetic proximity effects at
    the Al/EuS as well as the InAs/EuS interfaces are both essential to achieve topological
    superconductivity at zero applied magnetic field. Mapping the topological phase
    diagram as a function of gate voltages and proximity-induced exchange couplings,
    we show that the ferromagnetic hybrid nanowire with overlapping Al and EuS layers
    can become a topological superconductor within realistic parameter regimes. Our
    work highlights the need for a combined experimental and theoretical effort for
    faithful device simulation.

  title: Topological phonons in oxide perovskites controlled by light
  abstract: Perovskite oxides exhibit a rich variety of structural phases hosting
    different physical phenomena that generate multiple technological applications.
    We find that topological phonons – nodal rings, nodal lines, and Weyl points –
    are ubiquitous in oxide perovskites in terms of structures (tetragonal, orthorhombic,
    and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3), and external conditions
    (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular, in the tetragonal phase
    of these compounds all types of topological phonons can simultaneously emerge
    when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the tetragonal phase stabilized by
    thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited set of topological phonon states.
    In addition, we find that the photoexcited carrier concentration can be used to
    tune the topological phonon states and induce topological transitions even without
    associated structural phase changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as
    a versatile platform in which to study topological phonons and their manipulation
    with light.

  title: Strain-engineering the topological type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2
  abstract: In this work, the electronic and elastic properties of the type-II Dirac
    semimetal NiTe$_2$, in equilibrium and under strain, were systematically studied
    within the scope of density functional theory (DFT) and effective models. We have
    demonstrated that strain-engineering is an effective route for manipulating its
    electronic and topological properties. We have shown that compressive and tensile
    deformations control the Dirac node momentum and their energy relative to the
    Fermi level. Moreover, it is possible to lower or increase the overlap between
    the low-energy wave functions and suppress trivial bands, opening the way for
    superconductivity, Liftshtz transitions, and a hybrid type-I and type-II Dirac
    semimetallic phase. Furthermore, we provided a minimal effective model for the
    Dirac cone and derive the mentioned strain effects using lattice regularization,
    providing an inexpensive way for further theoretical investigations and easy comparison
    with experiments. We also proposed statically controlling the electronic-structure
    with the intercalation of alkali-element species into the van der Waals gap, resulting
    in a similar physical response to the one obtained by strain-engineering.

  title: Floquet Gauge Pump
  abstract: We introduce the concept of a Floquet gauge pump whereby a dynamically
    engineered Floquet Hamiltonian is employed to reveal the inherent degeneracy of
    the ground state in interacting systems. We demonstrate this concept in a one-dimensional
    XY model with periodically driven couplings and transverse field. In the high
    frequency limit, we obtain the Floquet Hamiltonian consisting of the static XY
    and dynamically generated Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) terms. The dynamically
    generated magnetization current depends on the phases of complex coupling terms,
    with the XY interaction as the real and DMI as the imaginary part. As these phases
    are cycled, it reveals the ground state degeneracies that distinguish the ordered
    and disordered phases. We discuss experimental requirements needed to realize
    the Floquet gauge pump in a synthetic quantum spin system of interacting trapped
    ions.

  title: Bloch-Lorentz magnetoresistance oscillations in delafossites
  abstract: Recent measurements of the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of delafossites
    (PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$) observed oscillations which closely resemble the Aharanov-Bohm
    effect. We develop a semiclassical theory of these oscillations and show that
    they are a consequence of the quasi-2D dispersion of delafossites. We observe
    that the Lorentz force created by an in-plane magnetic field makes the out-of-plane
    motion of electrons oscillatory, similarly to Bloch oscillations. Analysis of
    the visibility of these Bloch-Lorentz oscillations reveals the mean-free path
    to be $l \approx 4.4 \mu m$ in comparison to the literature in-plane mean free
    path of $20 \mu m$. The mean-free path is reduced as a consequence of the out-of-plane
    relaxation and sample wall scattering. Our theory offers a way to design an experimental
    geometry that is better suited for probing the phenomenon and to investigate the
    out-of-plane dynamics of ballistic quasi-two-dimensional materials.

  title: ‌Electrons Bloch-waltzing in Moire superlattices
  abstract: A striking prediction of the quantum theory of solids is that Bloch electrons
    in the presence of a constant electric field oscillate at a frequency tunable
    by the field and taking identical values for all carriers in the band. As a paradigmatic
    example of collective electron dynamics, Bloch oscillations received much attention,
    and yet, achieving this regime in solids proved to be challenging. This talk will
    discuss the new ideas and a new hope triggered by the advent of van der Waals
    heterostructures, in particular the flat bands in Moire graphene. There are several
    interesting not-yet-explored regimes harbored by these systems. One is synchronous
    oscillations of “enlightened” electrons coupled to “the big power in the sky”
    (the EM field of a proximal resonator)—a collective many-body dynamics that holds
    promise for THz electronics. Another is magnetic Bloch oscillations achieved by
    combining constant electric and magnetic fields. The unique dynamical regimes
    arising in this case are described by the Ashcroft-Mermin (AM) Hamiltonian. We
    will demonstrate that the AM dynamics is integrable and identify two distinct
    phases, electric and magnetic, exhibiting position-momentum duality—the orbits
    extended in the $k$ space and confined in the $x$ space, and vice versa. The boundary
    between the electric and magnetic phases hosts an interesting and presently poorly
    understood chaotic dynamical phase. The two phases—electric and magnetic—are of
    keen interest both as examples of complex quantum dynamics arising in a simple
    setting and because of their relevance for THz research.

  title: Orbital magnetism in graphene heterostructures
  abstract: "The earliest reports of ferromagnetism date to Thales of Miletus who\
    \ lived and wrote around 600 BC. Thales noted the ability of natural magnetite\
    \ to attract iron, and is said to have taken this as proof that matter itself\
    \ was alive. Our theories of magnetism have evolved considerably since then: we\
    \ now know that ferromagnetism arises from the interplay of the Coulomb repulsion\
    \ between electrons and their fermionic statistics. However, in one sense our\
    \ science has advanced only little: the vast majority of magnets, like magnetite,\
    \ consist of ordered arrangements of the electron spins stabilized by the spin\
    \ orbit interaction. In my talk, I will describe a new class of magnets based\
    \ on the spontaneous alignment of electron orbitals. Such orbital ferromagnetism\
    \ may be a generic phenomena, but has, to date, found its fullest expression in\
    \ graphene heterostructures in which the two dimensional orbits of electrons in\
    \ distinct momentum space valleys provide the underlying degree of freedom. \r\
    \nBecause orbital degrees of freedom arise directly from the band wavefunctions,\
    \ they are uniquely susceptible to experimental control via materials design.\
    \  Orbital magnets also enable new forms of magnetic control using in situ knobs.\
    \ For instance, orbital magnets in moire superlattice systems, where the band\
    \ structure features nontrivial topology, allow for field-effect switching of\
    \ magnetic moments and the resulting quantized anomalous Hall effects. I will\
    \ conclude with an outlook for realizing more exotic topological phases of matter\
    \ based on orbital magnetism."

  title: Fracton and Chern-Simons Theory
  abstract: Fracton order describes the peculiar phenomena that point excitations
    in certain strongly interacting systems either cannot move at all or are only
    allowed to move in a lower dimensional sub-manifold. It has recently been discovered
    in various lattice models, tensor gauge theories, etc. In this talk, we discuss
    how another powerful field theory framework -- the 2+1D Chern-Simons (CS) gauge
    theory -- can be used to provide new insight and explore new possibilities in
    3+1D fracton order. 2+1D U(1) gauge theories with a CS term provide a simple and
    complete characterization of 2+1D Abelian topological orders. To study 3+1D fracton
    order, we extend the theory by taking the number of component gauge fields to
    be infinity. In the simplest case of infinite-component CS gauge theory, different
    components do not couple to each other and the theory describes a decoupled stack
    of 2+1D fractional Quantum Hall systems with quasi-particles moving only in 2D
    planes -- hence a fractonic system. More interestingly, we find that when the
    component gauge fields do couple through the CS term, more varieties of fractonic
    orders are possible. For example, they may describe foliated fractonic systems
    which extends the framework found in exactly solvable models. Moreover, we find
    examples which lie beyond the foliation framework, characterized by 2D excitations
    of infinite order and braiding statistics that are not strictly local.

  title: Amorphous topological phases protected by continuous rotation symmetry
  abstract: Protection of topological surface states by reflection symmetry breaks
    down when the boundary of the sample is misaligned with one of the high symmetry
    planes of the crystal. We demonstrate that this limitation is removed in amorphous
    topological materials, where the Hamiltonian is invariant on average under reflection
    over any axis due to continuous rotation symmetry. While the local disorder caused
    by the amorphous structure weakens the topological protection, we demonstrate
    that the edge remains protected from localization. In order to classify such phases
    we perform a systematic search over all the possible symmetry classes in two dimensions
    and construct the example models realizing each of the proposed topological phases.
    Finally, we compute the topological invariant of these phases as an integral along
    a meridian of the spherical Brillouin zone of an amorphous Hamiltonian.

  title: Numerical evidence for marginal scaling at the integer quantum Hall transition
  abstract: The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious
    members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling flow
    close to the critical fixed point in the parameter plane spanned by the longitudinal
    and Hall conductivities has been studied vigorously both by experiments and with
    numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin
    down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details
    and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M. Zirnbauer [Nucl.
    Phys. B 941, 458 (2019)] has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition,
    in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow
    in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we
    provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations
    of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality,
    we confirm the marginal scaling of the longitudinal conductivity towards the conjectured
    fixed-point value $\sigma_{xx} = 2/\pi$. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism
    that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents $\nu_{eff}$,
    which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We confirm this
    idea by exact numerical determination of $\nu_{eff}$ in suitably chosen models.

    \ of systems: integrable models and many-body localized systems. In between these\
    \ two extreme limits there is, however, a whole range of models that exhibit more\
    \ complex dynamics, for instance, due to an emergent fragmentation of the Hilbert\
    \ space into many dynamically disconnected subspaces. Here, we realize such a\
    \ model by implementing the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model with a strong linear potential\
    \ [1] and observe strong initial-state dependent thermalization - a smoking-gun\
    \ signature of Hilbert-space fragmentation.\r\nEngineering quantum systems out-of-equilibrium,\
    \ on the other hand, further can be used as a tool to engineer novel quantum phases\
    \ of matter, which cannot be accessed in static realizations. To this end, the\
    \ system’s parameters are varied periodically, a method commonly known as Floquet\
    \ engineering [2]. This facilitated the realization of paradigmatic topological\
    \ lattice models and recently inspired ideas for implementing Z2 lattice gauge\
    \ theories [3]. The rich properties of topological Floquet systems, however, transcend\
    \ those of their static counterparts, resulting in a generalized bulk-edge correspondence.\
    \ As a consequence, topological edge modes can exist even in situations where\
    \ the bulk bands have zero Chern numbers. The novel properties of such anomalous\

  title: Deconfinement of Majorana vortex modes produces a superconducting Landau
    level
  abstract: A spatially oscillating pair potential $\Delta(r)=\Delta_0 e^{i K\cdot
    x}$ with momentum $K>\Delta_0/\hbar v$ drives a deconfinement transition of the
    Majorana bound states in the vortex cores of a Fu-Kane heterostructure (a 3D topological
    insulator with Fermi velocity $v$, on a superconducting substrate with gap $\Delta_0$,
    in a perpendicular magnetic field). In the deconfined phase at zero chemical potential
    the Majorana fermions form a dispersionless Landau level, protected by chiral
    symmetry against broadening due to vortex scattering. The coherent superposition
    of electrons and holes in the Majorana Landau level is detectable as a local density
    of states oscillation with wave vector $\sqrt{K^2-(\Delta_0/\hbar v)^2}$. The
    striped pattern also provides a means to measure the chirality of the Majorana
    fermions.

  title: Flat band induced non-Fermi liquid behavior of multicomponent fermions
  abstract: We investigate multicomponent fermions in a flat band and predict experimental
    signatures of non-Fermi liquid behavior. We use dynamical mean-field theory to
    obtain the density, double occupancy and entropy in a Lieb lattice for $\mathcal{N}
    = 2$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ components. We derive a mean-field scaling relation
    between the results for different values of $\mathcal{N}$, and study its breakdown
    due to beyond-mean field effects. The predicted signatures occur at temperatures
    above the N\'eel temperature and persist in presence of a harmonic trapping potential,
    thus they are observable with current ultracold gas experiments.

  title: Benefits of good old-fashioned crystalline perfection - new physics in ultra
    pure delafossite metals
  abstract: The delafossites are a series of layered compounds with triangular lattices
    similar to that of NaCoO2 but with a different stacking sequence along the c axis.  They
    are host to intriguing magnetic insulators and semimetals, as well as metals such
    as PdCoO2, PtCoO2, PdCrO2 and PdRhO2.  The properties of these metals are remarkable.  Although
    they are strongly two-dimensional, their room temperature electrical conductivity
    is higher per carrier than that of any elemental metal, and PdCoO2 crystals can
    have a low temperature resistivity of only a few nΩcm, corresponding to mean free
    paths of tens of microns.  I will describe recent experiments from my group in
    which we have established that the huge mean free paths result from extraordinarily
    low defect densities in the conducting planes of as-grown crystals, and give examples
    of new mesoscopic physics that can be observed as a result.  If time permits I
    will also discuss intriguing bulk and surface states that can be observed with
    extremely high resolution in angle resolved photoemission experiments.

  title: Cavity quantum materials
  abstract: "Recent years have seen tremendous progress in utilizing ultrafast light-matter\
    \ interaction to control the macroscopic properties of quantum materials [1].\
    \ Many of the most intriguing effects are based on nonthermal pathways, with the\
    \ material (quantum many-body system) being driven away from its thermal equilibrium\
    \ by strong laser pulses. While this has deepened our understanding of quantum\
    \ matter far from equilibrium and enabled us to build bridges to other fields\
    \ (quantum simulators, Floquet states of matter, (pre)thermalization, …), there\
    \ are a number of challenges: (i) the need for strong lasers, (ii) heating, (iii)\

  abstract: In this talk, I will comprehensively review the general electronic mechanism
    for superconductivity introduced in arXiv:2012.08528 and arXiv:2103.12060. There,
    it is shown that a non-retarded pairing interaction can be produced from the electron-electron

    is analytically controlled by a strong-coupling expansion in the kinetic energy
    term and explicitly demonstrated in doped band insulators with the example of
    an extended Hubbard model. This work demonstrates a powerful method for studying
    strong coupling superconductivity. It also offers realistic new routes to realize
    unconventional superconducting state with, for instance, finite angular momentum
    or spin-triplet pairing.

  title: Quantum many-body topology of quasicrystals
  abstract: In this paper, we characterize quasicrystalline interacting topological
    phases of matter i.e., phases protected by some quasicrystalline structure. We
    show that the elasticity theory of quasicrystals, which accounts for both "phonon"
    and "phason" modes, admits non-trivial quantized topological terms with far richer
    structure than their crystalline counterparts. We show that these terms correspond
    to distinct phases of matter and also uncover intrinsically quasicrystalline phases,
    which have no crystalline analogues. For quasicrystals with internal $\mathrm{U}(1)$
    symmetry, we discuss a number of interpretations and physical implications of
    the topological terms, including constraints on the mobility of dislocations in
    $d=2$ quasicrystals and a quasicrystalline generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Oshikawa-Hastings
    theorem. We then extend these ideas much further and address the complete classification
    of quasicrystalline topological phases, including systems with point-group symmetry
    as well as non-invertible phases. We hence obtain the "Quasicrystalline Equivalence
    Principle," which generalizes the classification of crystalline topological phases
    to the quasicrystalline setting.

  title: Realization of the field-free Josephson diode
  abstract: The superconducting analog to the semiconducting diode, the Josephson
    diode, has long been sought, with multiple avenues to realization proposed by
    theorists. Exhibiting magnetic-field free, single directional superconductivity
    with Josephson coupling of the supercurrent across a tunnel barrier, it would
    serve as the building-block for next-generation superconducting circuit technology.
    Here we realized the field-free Josephson diode using an inversion symmetry breaking
    heterostructure of $\mathrm{NbSe_2/Nb_3Br_8/NbSe_2}$. We demonstrate, for the
    first time without magnetic field, the junction can be superconducting in one
    direction while normal in the opposite direction. Based on that, half-wave rectification
    of a square-wave excitation was achieved with low switching current density ($~2.2\times
    10^2 \mathrm{A/cm^2}$), high rectification ratio ($~10^4$) and high robustness
    (at least $10^4$ cycles). We also demonstrate symmetric $\Delta I_\mathrm{c}$
    (the difference between positive and negative critical currents) behavior with
    field and the expected Fraunhofer current phase relation of a Josephson junction.
    This realization raises fundamental questions about the Josephson effect through
    an insulator when breaking symmetry, and opens the door to ultralow power, high
    speed, superconducting circuits for logic and signal modulation.

  title: Multiplet supercurrent in Josephson tunneling circuits
  abstract: The multi-terminal Josephson effect allows DC supercurrent to flow at
    finite commensurate voltages. Existing proposals to realize this effect rely on
    nonlocal Andreev processes in superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions.
    However, this approach requires precise control over microscopic states and is
    obscured by dissipative current. We show that standard tunnel Josephson circuits
    also support multiplet supercurrent mediated only by local tunneling processes.
    Furtheremore, we observe that the supercurrents persist even in the high charging
    energy regime in which only sequential Cooper transfers are allowed. Finally,
    we demonstrate that the multiplet supercurrent in these circuits has a quantum
    geometric component that is distinguinshable from the well-known adiabatic contribution.

  title: Correlation-induced valley topology in buckled graphene superlattices
  abstract: Flat bands emerging in buckled monolayer graphene superlattices have been
    recently shown to realize correlated states analogous to those observed in twisted
    graphene multilayers. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of valley topology driven
    by competing electronic correlations in buckled graphene superlattices. We show,
    both by means of atomistic models and a low-energy description, that the existence
    of long-range electronic correlations leads to a competition between antiferromagnetic
    and charge density wave instabilities, that can be controlled by means of screening
    engineering. Interestingly, we find that the emergent charge density wave has
    a topologically non-trivial electronic structure, leading to a coexistent quantum
    valley Hall insulating state. In a similar fashion, the antiferromagnetic phase
    realizes a spin-polarized quantum valley-Hall insulating state. Our results put
    forward buckled graphene superlattices as a new platform to realize interaction-induced
    topological matter.

  title: Superconductivity provides a giant enhancement to the spin battery effect
  abstract: We develop a theory of the spin battery effect in superconductor/ferromagnetic
    insulator (SC/FI) systems taking into account the magnetic proximity effect. We
    demonstrate that the spin-energy mixing enabled by the superconductivity leads
    to the enhancement of spin accumulation by several orders of magnitude relative
    to the normal state. This finding can explain the recently observed giant inverse
    spin Hall effect generated by thermal magnons in the SC/FI system. We suggest
    a non-local electrical detection scheme which can directly probe the spin accumulation
    driven by the magnetization dynamics. We predict a giant Seebeck effect converting
    the magnon temperature bias into the non-local voltage signal. We also show how

  title: Supercurrent diode effect and finite momentum superconductivity
  abstract: When both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, the critical
    current of a superconductor can be nonreciprocal. In this work we show that in
    certain classes of two-dimensional superconductors with antisymmetric spin-orbit
    coupling, Cooper pairs acquire a finite momentum upon the application of an in-plane
    magnetic field, and as a result, critical currents in the direction parallel and
    antiparallel to the Cooper pair momentum become unequal. This supercurrent diode
    effect is also manifested in the polarity-dependence of in-plane critical fields
    induced by a supercurrent. These nonreciprocal effects may be found in polar SrTiO$_3$
    film, few-layer MoTe$_2$ in the $T_d$ phase, and twisted bilayer graphene in which
    the valley degrees of freedom plays the role analogous to spin.

  title: Cavity magnon-polaritons in cuprate parent compounds
  abstract: Cavity control of quantum matter may offer new ways to study and manipulate
    many-body systems. A particularly appealing idea is to use cavities to enhance
    superconductivity, especially in unconventional or high-$T_c$ systems. Motivated
    by this, we propose a scheme for coupling Terahertz resonators to the antiferromagnetic
    fluctuations in a cuprate parent compound, which are believed to provide the glue
    for Cooper pairs in the superconducting phase. First, we derive the interaction
    between magnon excitations of the Ne\'el-order and polar phonons associated with
    the planar oxygens. This mode also couples to the cavity electric field, and in
    the presence of spin-orbit interactions mediates a linear coupling between the
    cavity and magnons, forming hybridized magnon-polaritons. This hybridization vanishes
    linearly with photon momentum, implying the need for near-field optical methods,
    which we analyze within a simple model. We then derive a higher-order coupling
    between the cavity and magnons which is only present in bilayer systems, but does
    not rely on spin-orbit coupling. This interaction is found to be large, but only
    couples to the bimagnon operator. As a result we find a strong, but heavily damped,
    bimagnon-cavity interaction which produces highly asymmetric cavity line-shapes
    in the strong-coupling regime. To conclude, we outline several interesting extensions
    of our theory, including applications to carrier-doped cuprates and other strongly-correlated
    systems with Terahertz-scale magnetic excitations.

  title: Spin-textured Chern bands in AB-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer
    MoTe2/WSe2
  abstract: While transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) based moire materials have
    been shown to host various correlated electronic phenomena, topological states
    have not been experimentally observed until now. In this work, using first principles
    calculations and continuum modeling, we reveal the displacement field induced
    topological moire bands in AB-stacked TMD heterobilayer MoTe2/WSe2. Valley contrasting
    Chern bands with non-trivial spin texture are formed from interlayer hybridization
    between MoTe2 and WSe2 bands of nominally opposite spins. Our study establishes
    a recipe for creating topological bands in AB stacked TMD bilayers in general,
    which provides a highly tunable platform for realizing quantum spin Hall and interaction
    induced quantum anomalous Hall effects.

  title: Ultrafast control of magnetic interactions via light-driven phonons
  abstract: Resonant ultrafast excitation of infrared-active phonons is a powerful
    technique with which to control the electronic properties of materials that leads
    to remarkable phenomena such as light-induced superconductivity, switching of
    ferroelectric polarization and ultrafast insulator-to-metal transitions. We will
    discuss how light-driven phonons can be utilized to coherently manipulate macroscopic
    magnetic states. Intense mid-infrared electric field pulses tuned to resonance
    with a phonon mode of the archetypical antiferromagnet DyFeO3 induce ultrafast
    and long-living changes of the fundamental exchange interaction between rare-earth
    orbitals and transition metal spins. Non-thermal lattice control of the magnetic
    exchange, which defines the stability of the macroscopic magnetic state, allows
    us to perform picosecond coherent switching between competing antiferromagnetic
    and weakly ferromagnetic spin orders. In this talk, the potential of resonant
    phonon excitation for the manipulation of ferroic order on ultrafast timescales
    will be emphasized.

  title: Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in the Magnetic Topological Insulator Thin
    Films
  abstract: "The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be considered as the quantum\
    \ Hall (QH) effect without an external magnetic field, which can be realized by\
    \ time-reversal symmetry breaking in a topologically non-trivial system [1, 2].\
    \ A QAH system carries spin-polarized dissipationless chiral edge transport channels\
    \ without the need for external energy input, hence may have a huge impact on\
    \ future electronic and spintronic device applications for ultralow-power consumption.\
    \ The many decades' quest for the experimental realization of the QAH phenomenon\
    \ became a possibility in 2006 with the discovery of topological insulators (TIs).\
    \ In 2013, the QAH effect was observed in thin films of Cr-doped TI for the first\

    \ negative prediction from first principle calculations [2], a high-precision\

  title: Strongly correlated electrons in atomically thin semiconductors
  abstract: In this talk, I will describe recent experiments in atomically-thin transition
    metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) where Coulomb interactions between electrons dominate
    over their kinetic energy. Our measurements provide a direct evidence that the
    electrons at densities < 3 · 10^11 cm-2 in a pristine MoSe2 monolayer form a Wigner
    crystal even at B = 0. This is revealed by our low-temperature (T = 80 mK) magneto-optical
    spectroscopy experiments that utilize a newly developed technique allowing to
    unequivocally detect charge order in an electronic Mott-insulator state. This
    method relies on the modification of excitonic band structure arising due to the
    periodic potential experienced by the excitons interacting with a crystalline
    electronic lattice. Under such conditions, optically-inactive exciton states with
    finite momentum matching the reciprocal Wigner lattice vector k = k­W get Bragg
    scattered back to the light cone, where they hybridize with the zero-momentum
    bright exciton states. This leads to emergence of a new, umklapp peak in the optical
    spectrum heralding the presence of periodically-ordered electronic lattice.

  title: Dirac Magic and Lifshitz Transitions in AA-Stacked Twisted Multilayer Graphene
  abstract: We uncover a new type of magic-angle phenomena when an AA-stacked graphene
    bilayer is twisted relative to another graphene system with band touching. In
    the simplest case this constitutes a trilayer system formed by an AA-stacked bilayer
    twisted relative to a single layer of graphene. We find multiple anisotropic Dirac
    cones coexisting in such twisted multilayer structures at certain angles, which
    we call "Dirac magic." We trace the origin of Dirac magic angles to the geometric
    structure of the twisted AA-bilayer Dirac cones relative to the other band-touching
    spectrum in the moir\'e reciprocal lattice. The anisotropy of the Dirac cones
    and a concomitant cascade of saddle points induce a series of topological Lifshitz
    transitions that can be tuned by the twist angle and perpendicular electric field.
    We discuss the possibility of direct observation of Dirac magic as well as its
    consequences for the correlated states of electrons in this moir\'e system.

  title: Can a solid-state quantum simulator help us understand materials?
  abstract: 'When we speak of a quantum computer today, we usually mean one that can
    run any algorithm. But the idea of using a quantum-based computer to simulate
    aspects of our quantum world goes back at least to Feynman in the early 1980s.
    Effective model Hamiltonians are central to condensed matter physics, as they
    can capture the essence of material properties while avoiding the full complexity
    of actual materials. But even those model Hamiltonians can be intractable to treat
    on classical computers. Very perfect realizations of model Hamiltonians relevant
    to materials can now be built with ensembles of cold atoms or with nanopatterned
    solid state systems similar to those used to make qubits. I will compare new experimental
    results to cutting-edge classical computation, and then ask: What happens when
    we (soon!) get our wish and achieve a "quantum simulator" that can describe certain
    interesting Hamiltonians with power beyond the best classical computers and algorithms?'

    electrical contacts and of Fermi liquid interactions, and we propose experiments

    of the counter-propagating states generated by the interface density mismatch.

  abstract: 'A general mechanism is presented by which topological physics arises
    in strongly correlated systems without flat bands. Starting from a charge transfer
    insulator, topology emerges when the charge transfer energy between the cation
    and anion is reduced to invert the lower Hubbard band and the spin-degenerate
    charge transfer band. A universal low-energy theory is developed for the inversion
    of charge transfer gap in an $xy$ antiferromagnet. The inverted state is found
    to be a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator with non-coplanar magnetism. Interactions
    play two essential roles in this mechanism: producing the Mott gap and quasiparticle
    bands necessary for band inversion, and driving non-coplanar magnetism after inversion.
    Our theory applies to and explains the recently observed QAH state in AB-stacked
    TMD bilayer MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$.'

  title: Longitudinal resistance oscillations in InSbAs 2DEGs in a Quantum Hall regime
  abstract: Integer quantum Hall states interacting with a superconducting electrode,
    are predicted to form Andreev edge states. This effect is expected to exhibit
    an oscillatory interference pattern in the longitudinal resistance, measured with
    respect to the grounded superconducting lead. In InSb-based two-dimensional electron
    gases we observe pronounced longitudinal  resistance oscillations. However, we
    verify that the origin of such oscillation is not related to the superconductivity,
    but rather, transport through the bulk in the disordered quantum Hall regime.
    Understanding the origin and location in parameter states of these oscillations
    is important to clearly distinguish between trivial and superconducting effects
    in the quantum Hall regime.

  title: SU(2) hadrons on a quantum computer
  abstract: We realize, for the first time, a non-Abelian gauge theory with both gauge
    and matter fields on a quantum computer. This enables the observation of hadrons
    and the calculation of their associated masses. The SU(2) gauge group considered
    here represents an important first step towards ultimately studying quantum chromodynamics,
    the theory that describes the properties of protons, neutrons and other hadrons.
    Quantum computers are able to create important new opportunities for ongoing essential
    research on gauge theories by providing simulations that are unattainable on classical
    computers. Our calculations on an IBM superconducting platform utilize a variational
    quantum eigensolver to study both meson and baryon states, hadrons which have
    never been seen in a non-Abelian simulation on a quantum computer. We develop
    a resource-efficient approach that not only allows the implementation of a full
    SU(2) gauge theory on present-day quantum hardware, but further lays out the premises
    for future quantum simulations that will address currently unanswered questions
    in particle and nuclear physics.

  title: Selective Control of Conductance Modes in Multi-terminal Josephson Junctions
  abstract: The Andreev bound state spectra of multi-terminal Josephson junctions
    form an artificial band structure, which is predicted to host tunable topological
    phases under certain conditions. However, the number of conductance modes between
    the terminals of multi-terminal Josephson junction must be few in order for this
    spectrum to be experimentally accessible. In this work we employ a quantum point
    contact geometry in three-terminal Josephson devices. We demonstrate independent
    control of conductance modes between each pair of terminals and access to the
    single-mode regime coexistent with the presence of superconducting coupling. These
    results establish a full platform on which to realize tunable Andreev bound state
    spectra in multi-terminal Josephson junctions.

  title: Topological defects in a double-mirror quadrupole insulator displace diverging
    charge
  abstract: We show that topological defects in quadrupole insulators do not host
    quantized fractional charges, contrary to what their Wannier representation indicates.
    In particular, we test the charge quantization hypothesis based on the Wannier
    representation of a parametric defect and a disclination. Against the expectations,
    we find that the local charge density decays as $\sim 1/r^2$ with distance, leading
    to a diverging defect charge. We identify sublattice symmetry and not higher order
    topology as the origin of the previously reported charge quantization.

  title: Automated reconstruction of bound states in bilayer graphene quantum dots
  abstract: Bilayer graphene is a nanomaterial that allows for well-defined, separated
    quantum states to be defined by electrostatic gating and, therefore, provides
    an attractive platform to construct tunable quantum dots. When a magnetic field
    perpendicular to the graphene layers is applied, the graphene valley degeneracy
    is lifted, and splitting of the energy levels of the dot is observed. Given the
    experimental ability to engineer this energy valley splitting, bilayer graphene
    quantum dots have a great potential for hosting robust qubits. Although bilayer
    graphene quantum dots have been recently realized in experiments, it is critically
    important to devise robust methods that can identify the observed quantum states
    from accessible measurement data. Here, we develop an efficient algorithm for
    extracting the model parameters needed to characterize the states of a bilayer
    graphene quantum dot completely. We introduce a Hamiltonian-guided random search
    method and demonstrate robust identification of quantum states on both simulated
    and experimental data.

  title: Can Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon and Majorana vortex states be distinguished
    in the presence of impurities?
  abstract: Majorana zero modes states (MZMs) are predicted to appear as bound states
    in vortices of topological superconductors. MZMs are pinned at zero energy and
    have zero charge due to particle-hole symmetry. MZMs in vortices of topological
    superconductors tend to coexist with other subgap states, named Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon
    (CdGM) states. The distinction between MZMs and CdGM is limited since current
    experiments rely on zero-bias peak measurements obtained via scanning tunneling
    spectroscopy. In this work, we show that a local impurity potential can push CdGM
    states to zero energy. Furthermore, the finite charge in CdGM states can also
    drop to zero under the same mechanism. We establish, through exploration of the
    impurity parameter space, that these two phenomena generally happen in consonance.
    This means that energy and charge shifts in CdGM may be enough to imitate spectroscopic
    signatures of MZMs.

  title: Theory of the supercurrent diode effect in Rashba superconductors with arbitrary
    disorder
  abstract: We calculate the non-reciprocal critical current and quantify the supercurrent
    diode effect in Rashba superconductors with arbitrary disorder, using the quasiclassical
    Eilenberger equation. The non-reciprocity is caused by the helical superconducting
    state, which appears when both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken.
    In the absence of disorder, we find a very strong diode effect, with the non-reciprocity
    exceeding 40% at optimal temperatures, magnetic fields and spin-orbit coupling.
    We establish that the effect persists even in the presence of strong disorder.
    We show that the sign of the diode effect changes as magnetic field and disorder
    are increased, reflecting the changes in the nature of the helical state.

  title: Superconducting diode effect in InSb nanowires Josephson junctions
  abstract: We study Josephson Junction in InSb nanowires with 15nm Tin shells. We
    observe critical current diffraction patterns skewed and inversion-symmetric in
    the magnetic field and bias direction. The effect is stronger when the external
    magnetic field is aligned perpendicular to the nanowire, in the substrate plane.
    i.e. in the most likely direction of the effective spin-orbit field in the junction.
    The effect is also tunable by the gate voltage. We discuss this effect in the
    context of phi0-Josephson junction physics, one consequence of which is known
    in recent literature as the superconducting diode effect. We consider alternative
    explanations such as the effective magnetic field and perform numerical simulations
    to understand our findings.

  title: The Josephson diode effect in supercurrent interferometers
  abstract: A Josephson diode is a non-reciprocal circuit element that supports a
    larger dissipationless super-current in one direction than in the other. In this
    work, we propose and theoretically study a class of Josephson diodes based on
    supercurrent interferometers containing mesoscopic Josephson junctions, such as
    point contacts or quantum dots, which are not diodes themselves but possess non-sinusoidal
    current-phase relations. We show that such Josephson diodes have several important
    advantages, like being electrically tunable and requiring neither Zeeman splitting
    nor spin-orbit coupling, only time-reversal breaking by a magnetic flux. We also
    show that our diodes have a characteristic AC response, revealed by the Shapiro
    steps. Even the simplest realization of our Josephson diode paradigm that relies
    on only two junctions can achieve efficiencies of up to ∼ 40% and far greater
    efficiencies are achievable by concatenating multiple interferometer loops.

  title: Greedy optimization of the geometry of Majorana Josephson junctions
  abstract: Josephson junctions in a two-dimensional electron gas with spin-orbit
    coupling are a promising candidate to realize topological superconductivity. While
    it is known that the geometry of the junction strongly influences the size of
    the topological gap, the question of how to construct optimal geometries remains
    unexplored. We introduce a greedy numerical algorithm to optimize the shape of
    Majorana junctions. The core of the algorithm relies on perturbation theory and
    is embarrassingly parallel, which allows it to explore the design space efficiently.
    By introducing stochastic variations in the junction Hamiltonian, we avoid overfitting
    geometries to specific system parameters. Furthermore, we constrain the optimizer
    to produce smooth geometries by applying image filtering and fabrication resolution
    constraints. We run the algorithm in various setups and find that it reliably
    produces geometries with increased topological gaps over large parameter ranges.
    The results are robust to variations in the optimization starting point and the
    presence of disorder, which suggests the optimizer is capable of finding global
    maxima.
